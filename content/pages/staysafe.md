This is truly an unprecedented time for our industry and the world as a whole.
The coronavirus has affected so many people throughout the world, and we are
very mindful of how this pandemic has turned peoplesâ€™ lives upside-down,
whether physically, financially, professionally, and mentally. We are
eternally grateful to the health care providers and first responders who are
working tirelessly through this unfolding crisis. We are closely monitoring
the needs of our community and helping in every way we can.

We have always and will continue to focus on the health and safety of our guests, talent, and team. We have worked tirelessly with government agencies and experts to help create a plan for safe physical experiences. Our team has also adapted to find creative solutions for brands to engage with their audiences in the expanded digital landscape, meaning that we can continue to serve clients even without in-person gatherings.

This is a very unique time with sensitive needs, but consumers are eager for open dialogue, meaningful conversations, entertainment, and positive stimulus. For the first time, the entire experiential industry has come together to work as a unit for the good of our clients, teams, and ultimately the public. We are a proud founding member of the Experiential Marketing Guild and will continue to help our industry and clients in every way possible.

Our founder Justin Lefkovitch, and fellow Mirrored teammates, have been acting as trusted resources helping to spread experiential safety guidelines and advice for publications including Event Marketer, Chief Marketer, and BizBash.

We are dedicated to the safety of our team, clients, and guests and will continue to innovate and implement safe and healthy guidelines to ensure work can go on, and we can continue to produce magic experiences for people around the globe.
