Mirrored Media established a mophie shop inside of the charging tent within the festival grounds.  With an average of 120 people per hour coming to charge their phones, mophie was well positioned as a ‘life savor’ where music fans were able to pick-up a charged case and go back to enjoying the show.

Mirrored Media established a mophie presence within the private VIP area at Coachella.  The VIP mophie tent was the only branded shop allowed within the VIP area at the festival.

Over ninety (90) artists, actors, and celebrities are now mophie ambassadors and fans sharing their love across social media.

Mirrored Media developed a series of custom branded mophie cases to give to fans across the globe.  Using Coachella as the backdrop, artists partnered with mophie to tweet, Facebook, Instagram and email about the ability to win a custom limited edition branded mophie case or charging pack.  Lucky fans on site at Cocahella were able to pick up their branded mophie cases and off site winners received their prizes at their doorsteps.

# Goal

Establish a foothold in music for mophie, a California-based, award-winning designer and manufacturer of mobile intelligent devices and accessories. Dubbed the creators of the original juice pack, mophie provides additional power to mobile handsets including; iPhone, Android, HTC One, and other devices.

 

# Program

Develop and execute a partnership with Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in order to establish an on-site presence for mophie throughout the festival. The campaign included a large presence within the VIP area, general stores, merchandising stores, charging tent, and campgrounds. Additionally, the campaign included brand ambassadors, artist gifting, artist partnerships (including) over ninety artists playing Coachella 2013 and artist driven sweeps offering fans exclusive limited edition branded mophie cases.
