**Tour Sponsorship**

After being the featured artist partner for #RoadToCoachella 2019, Khalid continued his relationship with BMW, naming them an “Official Partner of the Free Spirit Tour”. This sponsorship included a flyaway sweepstakes, social media surprise and delight ticket giveaways for fans, and a pop-up photo booth art installation at the Munich tour stop that gave a physical touchpoint for the German fan base. The US sweepstakes gave two lucky fans the opportunity to travel to Munich for a private tour through the BMW factory and Welt, meet Khalid, and go to the show in Munich. Also at the Munich tour stop, Mirrored Media produced an interactive photo moment for Khalid’s fans, featuring the wrapped Free Spirit #RoadtoCoachella BMW i8 outside the venue. This was a first of its kind tour sponsorship for BMW.

**On-site Activation**

Mirrored Media created an on-site activation at Khalid’s Munich tour stop, where fans of both Khalid and BMW could pose with the wrapped i8 outside the concert venue. This photo moment gave fans the unique and exciting opportunity to see the Free Spirit i8 in person, wrapped in Khalid’s artwork. Guests could take their own photos or get a polaroid photo that they could take with them for a physical memory of the activation.

**Sweepstakes**

Two lucky winners of a flyaway sweepstakes were flown to Munich for the Free Spirit tour stop as well as a meet and greet with Khalid and a private tour of the BMW Welt Museum, the largest tourist attraction in Munich. To garner entries, BMW USA and Khalid both posted across their social media channels, engaging with fans to encourage submissions. BMW flew the two winners flew to Germany for a fully packed trip, beginning with a private tour of the BMW Welt. The pair then got the chance to get their photos taken with Khalid at a meet & greet before attending the concert later that night.
