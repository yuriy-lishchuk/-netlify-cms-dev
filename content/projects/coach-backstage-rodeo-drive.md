Back in September, Coach started a new initiative called Coach Backstage, a project focused on emerging musicians. Along with a website dedicated to listing new talents — complete with a short and sweet bio of each artist, the latest news updates about them, a playlist of their most popular songs, and links to their social media sites — the American fashion brand also hosts a series of concerts.

Mirrored Media worked with Coach on its second backstage concert, linked to the new store on Rodeo Drive. Coach and Mirrored enlisted a pair of equally cool and talented musicians to perform for its Backstage series: Kid Cudi and Skylar Grey. The performers hit the stage on December 11th celebrating Coach’s reopening of its Rodeo Drive boutique in Beverly Hills.

As Coach focuses on a younger influential music demographic, Mirrored Media helped to align key influential artists with the store opening through interactive Instagram posts. The campaign focused on the influencer’s “backstage” moments in LA.  Each influencer posted professionally shot photos of themselves in their backstage location – where they feel creative and inspired. Fans were then given the opportunity to post their own backstage photos on instagram for the chance to win tickets to the Coach Backstage Concert.  Mirrored Media on-boarded Brandi Cyrus, Brandon Thompson, TOKiMONSTA, Kimberly Cole, Kerli, and Bethany from Best Coast for the exciting campaign.

For more than 70 years, Coach has been inspired by the sounds of New York City and the legendary performers who got their start There. This fall, Coach proudly launched Coach Backstage to support a new generation of emerging musical artists.
