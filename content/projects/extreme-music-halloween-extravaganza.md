We take Halloween very seriously around here, so we made sure to throw the craziest Halloween Party for our friends at Extreme Music!

On October 27, we packed the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood with a freaky set of performances by Cirque Berzerk and awesome shows by Kimberly Nicole and Courtesy Flush (Think Village People 2.0, just a hundred times kookier with Extreme CEO and Founder Russell Emanuel and itâ€™s lead).

Drinks were flowing, music was playing, and the most awesome costumes were awarded with amazing prizes including signed PRS guitars by Hans Zimmer. We have to thank all the Waldos, corpse brides, the Kim Kardashians, and the skeletons that came out to party with us! It was an unforgettable night.

Check out some of the photos below!
