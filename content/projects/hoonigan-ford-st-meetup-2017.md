On Saturday, January 28th, Hoonigan Industries teamed up with Mirrored Media to produce an exclusive Ford ST automotive meetup unlike any other. 

Ford ST owners and fans were invited to join Ford Performance, Hoonigan, Ken Block, and Vaughn Gitten Jr. in downtown LA, featuring indoor and outdoor activation spaces. 100 lucky ST owners had the opportunity to showcase their vehicles within the event space, and pull through a first-of-its-kind ST studio. At check-in, each of the select 100 ST owners was given a branded Ford Performance and Hoonigan pager, which notified them when it was time to enter the drive through photo booth.

Tony Harmer, the renowned photographer behind Ken Block’s livery and reveal photo shoots, was on site giving fans the opportunity of a lifetime to put their own ST in front of his lens. Our ST studio was built to replicate Harmer’s iconic shoots with Block. Each car was efficiently moved through the studio, giving all 100 ST owners their very own ST portfolio, courtesy of Harmer, Hoonigan, and Ford Performance.

Guests were also able to drift their own RC ST cars around our racetrack, create their own ST shirt in our t-shirt studio, learn more about the ST Octane Academy, and choose from a variety of local food trucks.

The event also featured branded ping pong and cornhole, as well as two Forza racing sleds, pitting guests against each other to see who could clock the fastest lap of the day.

Block and Gitten Jr. generously signed autographs and took photos with attendees throughout the day as they visited with fans. As the event came to a close, some of their signed items were auctioned off to a few lucky fans.

# About Hoonigan |

Spawned in 2011 by DC Shoes Co-Founder Ken Block and 0-60 Magazine Editor-in-Chief Brian Scotto, Hoonigan is a motorsport-lifestyle brand with a penchant for automotive debauchery. The company is dedicated to creating authentic products for the rebellious gear head. Its name, a portmanteau (Look it up, yo!), is the combination of “hooligan” and “hoon,” the Australian term for screwing about in cars. In addition to Block—made famous by his Gymkhana films—the Hoonigan team boasts a roster ranging from world champion drifters to Baja 1000 winners.

## About Ford Focus ST |

The Ford Focus ST made its debut in the 2009 British Touring Car Championship season, with Arena Motorsport. During its second season, the car ran on Liquefied Petroleum Gas, taking the first BTCC win for a car powered by this fuel at Brands Hatch. In 2011, Arena (also known as Team AON) shifted to the newer Focus Mk3, while Motorbase Performance drove the ST version. Both cars had engines, built by the Next Generation Touring Car engine rules. Motorbase continues to compete with the Ford Focus ST.
