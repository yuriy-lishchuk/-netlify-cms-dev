Through a series of live performances, special events, and strategic brand partnerships, TuneCore Live will give artists the chance to be seen by even more fans, music supervisors, and other industry executives. This will demonstrate to brands the value of partnering with TuneCore and their amazing roster of over a million account holders.

Mirrored Media teamed up with TuneCore and primary brand partner Swisher Sweets to support emerging artists. Swinghouse, DropKloud, and media giants Celebuzz and Spin joined in to round out the initial sponsor brands, allowing TuneCore to develop a robust schedule of programming to be announced throughout the year.

## Los Angeles, CA

TuneCore Live highlights some of the best and brightest independent music talent today. The performances occur during the last week of every month at Bardot in Los Angeles, one of Hollywood’s most historic music landmarks and celebrity hot spot! TuneCore Live has plans to expand into a multi-market series, which will aid in the support of artist visibility.

## Austin, TX

Mirrored Media teamed up with cigar giant Swisher Sweets to take over the world’s leading music industry event South by Southwest (SXSW) in Austin, Texas.

They were joined by Brooklyn Vegan, TuneCore, DropKloud, and CraveOnline to host six days of events at Red 7 and The Vulcan Gas Company, and gave festivalgoers the opportunity to sample, experience, and party with Swisher Sweets.

On March 20, SXSW festivalgoers experienced the first ever “TuneCore Live Austin,” featuring some of the top buzzing artists and surprise guest G Eazy jump on the stage. The event brought over 1,500 guests throughout the day. Performances for the event included:  Prinze George, Ultimate Painting, Sam Outlaw, Dear Boy, Nova Rockafeller, Devon Baldwin, Olivver The Kid, and Derek Minor.

CraveOnline’s showcase on Saturday March 21 proved to be a blowout of cinematically exhilarating proportions. The event drew over 3,200 guests in the doors. With a line stacked up the rain-soaked street long before doors even opened, the crowds would soon flood 5th avenue as they struggled for space to catch the wild dynamics of Action Bronson, Doomtree, Smallpools, Irontom and The Black Cadillacs at the Vulcan Gas Company.

Unexpected thrills happened like Action Bronson simply walking off stage at the end of his set and out the front door creating a mob experience for fans and festival goers who didn’t make it into the event to see his set. The event was featured as one of the top unofficial day parties on Do512. To see the behind the scenes interview with Action Bronsons interview click here.

Altogether, the events were a success – especially since SXSW presents unmatched networking opportunities, career-building conference programming and over 100 stages of music for showcasing bands and conference attendees. SXSW Music is now in its 29th year.

TuneCore, a leading digital music distribution and music publishing administration company, has always championed the artist and focused on the principle, “get more music to more people.” This year isn’t any different as they introduce an ambitious initiative to further support artist visibility to fans, music industry execs and brands with “TuneCore Live" monthly concert series and other creative programming.
