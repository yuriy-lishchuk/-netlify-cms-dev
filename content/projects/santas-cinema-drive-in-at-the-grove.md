To spread some holiday spirit, Mirrored Media and Caruso partnered to bring Santa’s Cinema to life at The Grove. The drive-in experience took place over two consecutive weeks in the lead up to Christmas and screened holiday favorites of *How the Grinch Stole Christmas* and *Elf* on the eighth-floor rooftop with panoramic views of Los Angeles.



At the entry, red and green lighting and lifesized nutcrackers welcomed cars and guided them to a socially distant Santa visit, where guests could speak with Santa from their cars and take photos. After being guided by parking attendants to their spots, Santa welcomed everyone and shared Christmas wishes while introducing the night’s movie live on the big screen.
