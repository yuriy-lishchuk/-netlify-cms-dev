Mirrored Media teamed up with Kellan Lutz’s to produce his 30th birthday party at Dan Bilzerian’s pad in Hollywood. The all white party had everything you could possibly think of from alligators to mermaids. The event brought some of Hollywoods A-list celebrities out like Ashley Greene, Josh Henderson, and Victor Ortiz just to name a few.

The invitation prompted attendees to come in white to gain entry, and guests did not disappoint; the crowd was as bright and beautiful as it gets here in Hollywood. Cocktails were sweetened with Absolut Elyx, which complimented the party’s sleek aesthetic. Celebs and friends of the honoree posed with alligators, a lemur, and an adorable baby kangaroo as they made appearances throughout the night. It’s amazing that the white-clad crowd somehow stayed so clean as they partied well into the wee hours of the morning.
