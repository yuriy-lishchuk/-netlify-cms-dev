Mirrored Media was back to celebrate VidCon’s 10th Anniversary with several activations both in the courtyard and inside the expo hall at VidCon 2019. This year we partnered with Viacom, AwesomenessTV, and Invisalign to create exciting opportunities for brands to connect with VidCon attendees in the courtyard.

Mirrored Media has had a prominent presence at VidCon for almost a decade, producing activations for some of the largest brands in attendance as the preferred agency of both VidCon and UTA. With Viacom now an integral part of the convention, we were tasked with creating an even bolder presence for the media giant. Along with Awesomeness and their respective partners Invisalign and Canon, our activations were the centerpiece of the Anaheim Convention Center’s outdoor Grand Plaza. A carnival slide, candy station, two photo activations, and an interactive Canon both gave Viacom an unmatched presence at the yearly convention. 

## Awesomeness and respective co-sponsors Invisalign and Canon tasked Mirrored Media with:

* Engaging consumers with bold activations
* Creating shareable moments
* Generating unique content for creators and attendees alike among the oversaturated VidCon atmosphere

## AwesomenessTV + Invisalign Rainbow Slide

This 30-foot high, three-lane slide, which was branded throughout, allowed guests to race each other to the bottom on branded burlap slide mats. Guests were also encouraged to use the custom Snapchat filter at a special banner hanging from the slide. 
 
Invisalign Snack Station
The Awesomeness x Invisalign Candy Station rose 15 feet high and featured 20 dispensers with various candies in rainbow colors. Anticipating the weight of the candy and the heat of the relentless summer sun, the Mirrored team had to re-engineer the traditional candy dispensers to allow guests to experience this unique, shareable, and delicious moment for four days. The dispensers also had an outer display tube, so no matter how quickly the interior contents were devoured, the aesthetics always remained on-brand and colorful.
 
## AwesomenessTV Branded Photo Walls

Right next to the Candy Station sat a massive 12’x8’ Awesomeness mural. This piece was splashed with bright colors and was lit up at night, allowing guests to capture the perfect shareable photo day or night. The AwesomenessTV sequin wall provided a gorgeous photo moment for guests upon entering the plaza. The shiny, colorful, sparkling 8’x8’ piece could be seen throughout the entire outdoor plaza. 

Through these eye-catching activations, we allowed Awesomeness and their partners to own VidCon’s Grand Plaza and exceed their goals, creating dozens of shareable moments, memorable experiences at our bold activations, and millions of impressions through original content. We conveyed brand narratives and gave them unique ways to engage with the notoriously oversaturated and fickle VidCon audience.
