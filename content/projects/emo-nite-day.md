To celebrate its three-year anniversary, Emo Nite teamed up with Goldenvoice to produce Emo Nite Day at the Shrine Expo Hall in Los Angeles on December 3rd, 2017. This day-long mini-festival featured a packed lineup of Emo Nite regulars as well as superstar special guests. Mirrored Media acted as a production and creative consultant to help bring this exclusive show to life.

Spanning over 10 hours and four stages in several areas within the Shrine, Emo Nite Day featured a non-stop lineup of DJs, bands, and special guests. Much like the monthly Emo Nites in Echo Park, except bigger and better, DJs spun pop-punk and emo tracks from the heydey of the genre while other artists performed fan-favorites, new and old. Highlights included:

+ The Chainsmokers
+ Demi Lovato
+ Captain Cuts
+ Machine Gun Kelly
+ The Used
+ Finch
+ Tigers Jaw
+ Travis Mills
+ From First to Last
+ Lil Xan
+ Frank Zummo
+ Craig Owens

Decor was fully on-brand with Emo Nite and included a 10-foot tall inflatable grave boy, a Nosferatu photo wall, oversized custom black and white balloons that hung from the ceiling, custom stage signage, and giant cutout letters on stage that spelled ‘Emo Nite Day’. Mirrored Media also worked with the Fire Marshal to provide custom stage barricades that could be removed and reinstalled easily between DJ and band performances.

In addition to managing the main stage, Mirrored also assisted with managing the other stages, setup and teardown, advancing with Goldenvoice, and venue liaising.

Emo Nite Day ended up a resounding success, with its founders telling fans, “The last three years have been a wild, wild ride. Never in our wildest dreams when we decided to invite a few of our friends on a Tuesday nite to a dive bar in Echo Park to listen to emo and pop punk music, that it would turn into something like this.”
