To celebrate the premiere of the new Focus Features film Let Him Go, starring Kevin Costner and Diane Lane, Mirrored Media worked with Focus to produce a digital event that would give audience members an intimate look into the making of the film. Invited guests to the filmmaker panel received digital invites via email that featured the film’s key art and logo lockup.

The panel began with an introduction from the film’s producers, Mitchell Kaplan and Paula Mazur, followed by a conversation featuring writer/director Thomas Bezucha, actors Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, and Lesley Manville, and moderated by Dave Karger. The digital panel gave invited guests the opportunity to hear directly from the cast about the characters, costumes, and setting of this modern Western.
