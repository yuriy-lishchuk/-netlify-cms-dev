Warm summer nights are here, bringing with them the cool sounds of The Grove Summer Concert Series, Presented by Citi.

On August 1, we round out the series with the chart-topping rock trio X Ambassadors, best known for their hits “Jungle,” “Unsteady” and “Renegades,” as well as singles from their upcoming album, “Joyful.”

The complimentary concert began at 8PM with a pre-show DJ at 7PM over The Grove’s iconic dancing fountain.
