@Summerbreak launched their second season at this year’s Vidcon Conference in Anaheim with a splash. We worked alongside Fullscreen and @SummerBreak to bring the YouTube-based show to life through a private, invite-only Venice beach themed pool party on Friday, June 27. Cast members and other YouTube stars like Alexis G. Zall could interact with guests over some tacos and pizza, pose on the custom beach-sanded blue carpet step and repeat, get crazy at the PHHHOTO gif booth, and slow down time at the slow-motion video booth. Our party rocked Anaheim with DJ sets by The M Machine and Evan Rosen, and surprise break dance performances by YouTube star, Whzgud!

Mirrored Media was excited to partner with Fullscreen, Inc on the [@Summerbreak](https://www.youtube.com/user/SummerBreakNetwork) Launch Party around [VidCon](http://vidcon.com/).  @SummerBreak follows a group of LA kinds living out loud on the beaches of Southern California for their final summer together.  The party will launch the second season of the show with a new cast and some familiar faces featuring a DJ set by The M Machine.

Fullscreen, Inc powers the creation and sharing of videos.  Their network unites premier online talent and the world’s leading brands with more than 400MM+ massively engaged subscribers.
