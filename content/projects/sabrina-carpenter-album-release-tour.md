To celebrate Sabrina Carpenter’s newest release, “Almost Love”, from her forthcoming album Singular, Hollywood Records enlisted Mirrored Media to produce a five-city tour that gave fans an up-close-and-personal experience with Sabrina as she debuted unreleased music and performed the new single.

The event series took place over the course of three weeks in July 2018 with stops in major markets throughout the US. Fan club members and radio contest winners packed intimate venues in Chicago, Dallas, New York City, Miami, and San Francisco for a variety of activations that culminated with an exclusive appearance from Sabrina herself.

With Sabrina set to share unreleased music from her personal phone, fans were required to relinquish their phones upon entry, creating an even more exclusive and intimate experience. After checking in, fans gathered inside the venue to enjoy catered hors d’oeuvres and desserts along with a variety of activations. DJ Alex D spun tracks while also encouraging brave fans to step up to the karaoke machine, which featured a playlist curated by Sabrina herself. Attendees were also invited to write down questions for Sabrina that would be asked of her during an exclusive Q&A after the performance.

Each venue was carefully curated to match the aesthetic of Sabrina’s new release, with Roman busts displayed throughout the space. A photo booth experience with the statue of David gave fans a chance to capture instantly shareable content with a custom overlay specific to each city. “Almost Love” lyric decals were affixed throughout the space along with pull-up banners and album art.

Once everyone was settled in, Sabrina was introduced to the stage for an exclusive performance of “Almost Love”, immediately followed by a fan Q&A hosted by DJ Alex D. Sabrina then surprised fans by playing several unreleased songs from her upcoming record – some unfinished – directly from her phone. She even detailed personal stories of how each one came to be, much to the delight of the die-hard fans in attendance.

The events came to a close with a personal meet & greet with Sabrina in front of an album-inspired red curtain. Every single attendee was able to chat with Sabrina and get two photos taken: one available digitally and one keepsake Polaroid they could take with them.
