The Grove Summer Concert Series kicked off with a performance by multi-platinum selling recording artist Andy Grammer. As the first male pop star in a decade to have his first two singles reach the Top 10, Grammer has taken the music world by storm with a succession of pop anthems. His debut album featured the platinum singles “Keep Your Head Up” and “Fine By Me.” Andy’s second album, Magazines or Novels, featured the triple platinum infectious smash hit “Honey, I’m Good” and the certified gold anthem “Good To Be Alive (Hallelujah).” Andy’s third full length album, The Good Parts, was released in December 2017 and includes his global smash hit single “Fresh Eyes,” which has become a streaming phenomenon with over 300 million total streams. The complimentary concert began at 8PM with a pre-show DJ at 7PM, and opening act Rozzi at 7:30PM. Select Citi VIPs got to meet and Andy Grammer and get photos.
