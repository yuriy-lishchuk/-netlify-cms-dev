Mirrored Media teamed up with the American luxury fashion brand Coach for their 2014 Fall line release. “The iconic heritage brand has changed dramatically this year. After taking a look into the archives of the most classic handbag silhouettes and reinterpreting them with moto-esque elements and updated hardware, along with a fresh approach to apparel (most noteworthy, outerwear), Vevers somehow transformed Coach from your mom’s favorite label to a total cool-girl staple” says Refinery29.

As Coach focuses on a younger influential demographic, Mirrored Media helped to align key influential artists with Coach’s new 2014 Fall interactive Instagram based look book.  Mirrored Media on-boarded Anna Lunoe, Betty Who, Nervo, Noelle Scaggs, SoSuperSam, Hanna Hooper, Skylar Grey, Posso, Tokimonsta, and Caroline D’Amore for the exciting campaign.  Mirrored Media’s artist posts only comprised 3.7% of all #CoachFall2014 posts on Instagram, however generated over 9% of the total campaign engagement and over 10% of total campaign followers.  Additionally, Mirrored Media’s artists made up 46% of the top 11 tweets for the campaign.
