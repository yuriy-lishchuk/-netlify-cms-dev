Sour Patch Kids teamed up with Fullscreen to launch its new Breaking Out video series back in October 2014, and since then the series has been a hit.

To continue this engagement, SPK and Fullscreen partnered with Mirrored Media to throw the most amazing prom ever at the Loews Hotel, in Santa Monica, CA. On Saturday May 30, social media superstars Andrea Russett, Meredith Foster, Jack Gilinsky and Jack Johnson appeared at Loews to meet their sweeps winner prom dates.

Fans chose their favorite YouTube star and asked them to prom by using the hashtag #SPKpromposal. “SPKpromposal” is when you ask a person you watch online ALL THE TIME to the SPK Prom in L.A. in a super romantic or crazy funny way. Fans from all over participated by coming up with unique and creative promposals for their favorite YouTube stars.

The winners were not only able to meet their favorite stars, but they danced the night away with the celeb they promposed to, enjoyed a Q&A about their upcoming series, and received some exclusive SPK merchandise and candy. Oh, we can’t forget the part where they were able to jump into the photo booth with their favorite star. It was a huge success!
