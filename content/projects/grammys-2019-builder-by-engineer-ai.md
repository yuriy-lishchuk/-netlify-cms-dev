Technological innovation and the heart-pounding power of music collided when Mirrored Media partnered with Builder by Engineer.ai for two exclusive activations during the 2019 Grammy Awards weekend. To showcase the incredible power of this platform, we created a space where best-selling artists could engage with cutting-edge apps, all while entertaining their fans and celebrating the spirit of the Grammys.

First up was the Childish Gambino/Ludwig Göransson Pre-Grammy event, hosted at West Hollywood’s ultra-exclusive Wheelhouse. Top-notch talent, including Grammy nominees and performers, were treated to a VIP experience with mixed drinks provided by Hennessy, as well as a custom-curated lounge sponsored by Engineer.ai. Guests were spread throughout the house and its picturesque backyard, while tracks from the Red Bull-sponsored DJ kept the party going late into the night. All throughout the space, Builder-branded content looped on TV screens, while custom signage helped further engage guests with this groundbreaking new platform.

In addition to Grammy-winner Gambino and Academy Award-winner Göransson, notable attendees at our sponsored activation included:

+ Terry Crews
+ HAIM
+ K.Flay
+ Miya Folick
+ Miguel
+ Hannibal Buress

Builder is the future of app development, which is why Mirrored Media also partnered them with Grammy Award-winning legends The Roots for their annual Grammy Jam. Occurring the week before the Grammy Awards, The Roots Jam Session is a two-day event that brings together an eclectic and unforgettable mix of musicians for an impromptu jam session with backing from the legendary Roots Crew; a group that Rolling Stone magazine has called “one of the 20 greatest live acts in the world.”

Guest performers included:

+ 2 Chainz
+ Anderson .Paak
+ Esperenza Spalding
+ Swizz Beatz
+ India Arie
+ Chad Smith of the Red Hot Chili Peppers
+ Jon Batiste

With this caliber of guest on the list, The Roots needed a platform that they could customize and trust. That’s why they collaborated with Builder to create a personalized platform that they were able to easily upload their list of attendee names into, with multiple different ticket types. This new platform allowed the Roots to own the process from start to finish – as opposed to trying to work around a pre-built, generic RSVP platform like Eventbrite. On-site, managers had admin access direct from their phones, while check-in staff raved about the ease of the platform and its ability to easily search guests by their first or last name and by the individual who invited them. Plus, with a one touch check-in, we kept the line moving while also ensuring that there were no accidental duplicates, repetitions, or errors.

Additionally, our on-site activation included TVs looping branded content, dynamic custom wrapping and custom-built, color-changing light cubes emblazoned with the Builder logo. Our vibrant signage could be seen throughout the General Admission, VIP, and Backstage spaces during both nights of the vent. At the same time, Brand ambassadors met with guests to discuss their app concepts, and ways that Builder could help bring those ideas to life.

Both of these events became buzzy, must-attend activations for the 2019 Grammy weekend, with guest lists and performer line-ups rivalling the awards show itself. More importantly, both activations organically utilized the Builder brand and their platform’s capabilities to keep things running smoothly and efficiently – a benefit Mirrored Media passed on to all the attendees who had come out to drink, dance, and get down to their favorite artists.
