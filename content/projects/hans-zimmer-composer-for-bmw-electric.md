Santa Monica/Munich. In June 2019 at the #NEXT Gen in Munich, Hans Zimmer and BMW Sound Designer Renzo Vitale presented their jointly developed e-sound for the BMW Vision M NEXT. In Santa Monica Hans Zimmer has now officially announced his partnership with the BMW Group to further develop BMW IconicSounds Electric. Hans Zimmer: “We have the unique opportunity to turn electric driving in a BMW into a magnificent experience with outstanding sonority. I am really looking forward to the challenge of shaping the sound for future electric BMW’s. Developing the sounds for the BMW Vision M NEXT together with Renzo Vitale was already an inspiring, new experience for me.”

**Jointly developed sound to enter series vehicles already in 2020**

Prior to the Los Angeles Auto Show, Hans Zimmer and BMW Sound Designer Renzo Vitale gave exclusive insights into their previous collaboration at Hans Zimmer’s studio in Santa Monica. In this exact studio, where Hans Zimmer usually composes his famous scores for Hollywood movies, the two jointly developed the e-sound of the BMW Vision M NEXT. Furthermore Zimmer and Vitale revealed their most recent co-creation: The sound signaling readiness for driving in purely electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles of the BMW brand. The sound will enter series vehicles already in 2020. Renzo Vitale: “Sound Design gives us the opportunity to evoke positive emotions in our vehicles. This new start-sound triggers joyful anticipation of the electric drive, when the customer enters his vehicle and presses the Start/Stop button.”

**BMW IconicSounds Electric**

The silence of driving electrically is often cited as a major advantage of electric mobility. However, as the range of electrified models increases, a gap in the emotionality of the driving experience arises for the driver. Under the brand name “BMW IconicSounds Electric” a visionary sound offer will be created for future electrified vehicles from BMW. Stefan Ponikva, Vice President BMW Brand Experience: “Over the years, the sound of our vehicles has enthused and accompanied millions of people. We are very excited about the exceptional chance of creating the sounds for BMW’s electric mobility together with Hans Zimmer. Thereby we can charge future emotions of our customers worldwide anew and redefine sheer driving pleasure.”

As composer and curator of BMW IconicSounds Electric Hans Zimmer will contribute his expertise to various projects for sound creation for electrified BMW vehicles worldwide. The variety of projects may include sounds for vision vehicles and concepts, series vehicles, composition of sound signs, but also sound creation for communicative occasions focusing on the acoustic-emotional character of electric mobility.

**BMW Group has been developing sound for electric mobility for around ten years now**
In 2009, with the introduction of the MINI E test fleet, acoustic engineers from the BMW Group were already working on artificially generated sound, which was intended to contribute to the better perceptibility of vehicles with barely audible drivetrains. Since the launch of the BMW i3, customers have therefore been able to choose acoustic pedestrian protection as optional equipment.

The sound of the acoustic pedestrian protection has since been further developed in line with new legislative requirements and is now gradually being rolled out as standard in all plug-in hybrids and all-electric vehicles from BMW (requirements for acoustic pedestrian protection as well as operating times vary worldwide). The aim in the development was to fulfil the important warning function without disturbing pedestrians. At the same time, the customer should continue to enjoy a high level of acoustic comfort in the vehicle.
