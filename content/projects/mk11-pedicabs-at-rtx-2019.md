Mortal Kombat is back and better than ever in the next evolution of the iconic franchise. To celebrate the release of MK11 highlight the tournament and activations within RTX, WarnerMedia, Rooster Teeth, and Mirrored Media teamed up to create custom MK11 pedicabs. The custom pedicabs gave anyone with an RTX badge a free ride throughout downtown Austin. 

While riding, guests had the unique opportunity to battle against each other within the onboard MK11 gaming station powered by Nintendo Switch. Controllers on each side of the pedicab allowed fans the chance to play the new game during their ride. The cabs had sound systems built in to fully immerse guests into the Kombat.
