**The Live Stream**

Mirrored Media partnered with Participant Media for a series of live stream conversations centered around the new documentary, Slay the Dragon. 

Preceding the live stream, invited viewers from a coalition of partner organizations were able to participate in a free one week screening window of the film. After viewing, invitees for the Fair Maps Texas event then had the opportunity to join the live panel discussion with Slay the Dragon film subject and Executive Director of The People, Katie Fahey, Executive Director of Common Cause -Texas, Anthony Gutierrez, and Texas State Representative Mary González. During the Mother Jones event, event attendees joined a discussion with moderator Carlene Bechen from Wisconsin Voices, Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes, Senior Reporter with Mother Jones, Ari Berman, and Executive Director of Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, Angela Lang.

The branded streams began with an introduction from Participant’s Social Impact team, who welcomed viewers and framed the discussion that was about to begin, before handing things off to the moderators. Our panelists were able to engage in a candid conversation around the film subject of gerrymandering in their respective communities. Moving towards the end of the hour-long event, viewers could submit questions in a chat feature built into the landing page for the events, which would then be selected and passed through to the moderators.

These events were a successful iteration of this new partnership with Participant and left the production team, clients, panelists, and audience members excited for more!

**About Slay The Dragon**

A secretive, high-tech gerrymandering initiative launched 10 years ago threatens to undermine our democracy. Slay the Dragon follows everyday people as they fight to make their votes matter.

Slay the Dragon follows everyday people, outraged by what they see as an attack on the core democratic principle that every person’s vote should count equally. This election year, we’re joining together with grassroots partners to put an end to gerrymandering. Because this issue impacts each state differently, we’ve created a map to help you navigate how gerrymandering affects your state and community. Slay the Dragon arrives on demand April 3.
