In March 2018, Mirrored Media teamed up with Fullscreen to produce an exclusive advance screening event around the upcoming film, The Miracle Season, in Chicago, IL. The movie is based on the true story of an Iowa high school volleyball team overcoming the odds after tragically losing its team leader.

Guests were invited to the event via social media posts by some of their favorite influencers, many of whom would be attending the screening. Fans lined up as early as 8am for the chance to get up close and personal with their favorite influencers, watch the early screening, and participate in a variety of on-site activations. Upon check-in, where they received a wristband and concessions voucher, guests were invited to walk the red carpet for a photo in front of a Miracle Season step and repeat. This shareable photo booth opportunity also included a volleyball-themed custom overlay. From there, they were directed to the main theater.

Inside the theater, attendees were encouraged to stop at the activation areas that included hair braiding, hair chalking, and flash tattoos. A custom holding card was displayed on the theater screen as an upbeat playlist pumped through the sound system. After about 90 minutes of photos and activations, guests redeemed their vouchers for popcorn, soda, and candy, and got settled in for the early afternoon premiere.

The touching film brought many to tears, but that would be countered by extreme excitement afterwards, as five influencers and one of the filmâ€™s actresses met and took photos with fans. On hand were influencers Mia Stammer, Ashley Nichole, Alyson Stoner, Alisha Marie, and Valentina Genta, in addition to actress Lillian Doucet-Roche. The line of fans stretched all the way around the main lobby as they waited their turn to take photos, get autographs, and talk in-depth with their favorite stars. It was truly an unforgettable experience for those in attendance and generated buzz for the film a week ahead of its wide release.
