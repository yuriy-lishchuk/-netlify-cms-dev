For the third consecutive year, Mirrored Media teamed up with BMG Production Music to host an exclusive party after the Production Music Conference in Hollywood. The September 25th, 2019 event took over Liaison nightclub in the center of Hollywood, with over 400 BMG employees, clients, writers, and special guests in attendance to celebrate the full-service sound agency, its artists, and the BMG team. After a full day at the adjacent Loews Hotel, guests were invited to kick back at Liaison to enjoy live entertainment, a DJ, an array of gourmet hors dâ€™oeuvres, and specialty cocktails. Custom BMG branding and signage adorned the elegant space, along with a red carpet and step and repeat on the outdoor patio. A custom BMG 3D hologram even hovered above the dancefloor inside the venue. 

Guests were treated to a special performance by world-renowned DJ Machinedrum, courtesy of BMG subsidiary Ninja Tune Production Music. Los Angeles-based DJ Mark Jackson kicked the night off as things ahead of Machinedrum. 

Guests were also encouraged to try a unique champagne-pouring experience in which aerial acrobats were suspended from a 10-foot high lollipop ring while serving eager guests below. A branded photo booth allowed guests to capture and share highlights of their evening both in print and on socials.

As guests finally filed out after an exciting night, they left with a gift bag of BMG and Ninja Tune premiums, including records, stickers, and more.

BMG and its team were elated with the success of the event, as it has now become a staple and much-anticipated event each September.
