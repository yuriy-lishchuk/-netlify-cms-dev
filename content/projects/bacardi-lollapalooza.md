Mirrored Media built out a custom 1862 Cuban roadside Bodega Bar. Guests visiting the North VIP Lollapalooza Lounge had the opportunity to walk up and experience a range of Bacardi cocktails, featuring the Cuba Libre in a special bronze cup. Focusing on the brand’s past and future, our Bacardi Cuban Roadside walk up bar features an array of custom barrels and a a Bacardi pyramid illuminated in a center. The hand-branded and aged barrel bar was designed to highlight that all Bacardi rums are aged in barrels and provide guests with an immersive brand experience, as apposed to just a standard tented bar. The bar also featured a three-sided smooth-treated wood surface with a raw bark exterior around the bar edges. Along with their drinks, guests were able to enjoy Bacardi-supplied customized drink koozies, patches, sunglasses, backpacks, and even Bacardi headphones.

Mirrored Media teamed up with Bacardi at this year's Lollapalooza festival in Chicago to give VIP guests a truly unique bar experience.
