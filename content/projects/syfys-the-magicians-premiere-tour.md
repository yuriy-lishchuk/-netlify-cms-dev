For the launch of its highly- anticipated series, The Magicians, Syfy partnered with Mirrored Media to launch a buzz worthy promotional campaign. Syfy needed to create a promotional campaign that would cut through the entertainment clutter and reach the show’s target audience – Millennials.

To reach millennials, the campaign hit on key millennial passion points like music, social experiences, and events and partnered with Warner Bros. Records and Fullscreen to embark on a five market college tour to promote The Magicians.  Each tour stop was hosted by a different popular social media personality and featured an advance screening of the first episode, a live acoustic performance by millennial musician Bebe Rexha, cast appearances, branded concessions and shareable social activations.

Mirrored Media partnered with millennial musician, Bebe Rexha to reach true music fans and generate buzz surrounding The Magicians.  Bebe is a songwriter and singer who penned what would become Eminem’s global hit song “The Monster” and currently her duet with G-Easy, “Me, Myself & I” is #1 on Billboard hip hop.  The partnership married the two brands together by debuting Bebe’s new, never before heard single “No Broken Hearts” in a Magicians trailer.  The trailer ran on-air, on Syfy.com and was posted on Syfy social handles garnering over 750K views on YouTube alone.

_The Magicians,_ written by American author Lev Grossman, is a trilogy of fantasy novels about a group of students who attend a college of magic in New York City, which _The New York Times_ described as "_Harry Potter_ for adults".  _The Magicians_ presented a unique opportunity to reach millennials and connect them to Syfy.   The success of the novels offered access to millennials and Syfy wanted to build on that, expand it, and transform it into new Syfy viewers by creating a disruptive experience that would complement their overall media campaign and generate buzz amongst consumers, press and social media influencers.
