Mirrored Media had the pleasure of working with Focus Features bring their new film Half Brothers to life, as part of the film’s virtual premiere. Invited guests of the studio received a premiere invite and digital activity kit via email. The digital kit contained 10-15 pages that included information on how to access the screening, recipes like the “Fly Like Paper” cocktail and guacamole to prepare ahead and enjoy while watching, and activities related to the plot and themes of the film, like a Mexican slang word search and custom Half Brothers Lotería cards.

Before the movie began, a live-to-tape filmmaker intro welcomed viewers and the film’s stars, Luis Gerardo Méndez and Connor Del Rio hosted a happy hour with a Half Brothers spin on the paper plane cocktail, whose recipe was included in the digital kit. After the virtual premiere, a countdown appeared onscreen, letting viewers know that a Q&A discussion with the filmmakers and cast was about to begin. This panel featured custom on-screen graphics and a lively conversation around the making of Half Brothers, now playing in theaters.
