## Mirrored Media and Emo Nite LA Team Up to Celebrate LA’s 2nd Annual Emo Nite Day

Mirrored Media was thrilled to return to the Shrine alongside Ride or Cry  to produce the 2nd annual Emo Nite Day. The party featured performances from artists like Dashboard Confessional, All Time Low, Mayday Parade, 3OH!3 (Performing WANT in its entirety), Boyfriendz x Gothboiclique and Saphir along with DJ Sets from Mark Hoppus (full Blink-182 set), Captain Cuts, GNASH, Ham on Everything and more!!!

The second annual full-day festival took place on October 13th at Shrine Expo Hall + Grounds. On the monumental anniversary and announcement, the Emo Nite founders share “Last year’s Emo Nite Day was truly amazing and we’re super excited to be doing it again, bigger than ever. We first met and became friends at a karaoke bar where we decided to sing a Dashboard Confessional song together, so it’s very surreal now, 4 years later, to be organizing a festival co-headlined by the very band that brought us together.” 

Emo Nite LA, the event started by three friends (Babs Szabo, T.J. Petracca and Morgan Freed) at a small dive bar has grown into a full-blown phenomenon. They have been able to bring together some of the most incredible names in music who have become part of this Emo Nite “family”, including Halsey, Sonny Moore (Skrillex) and From First to Last, The Used, Post Malone, Good Charlotte, All American Rejects, Demi Lovato, New Found Glory, and so many more. They have been able to throw regular events in dozens of markets across the country and have had spots on lineups at festivals like Life is Beautiful, Slam Dunk, BUKU and Vans Warped Tour. In addition to these events, the Emo Nite founders have created successful clothing collabs with companies like OBEY, Urban Outfitters, PLEASURES, Rose in Good Faith, Chinatown Market, OWSLA and more. But above all else, Emo Nite LA brings together people who share the love of emo rock music from the 90’s, 2000’s, and today, changing the idea of what a music event can be. 

“We’re so lucky to have such a strong and of supportive community of people that have grown with us over the last few years and continue to trust us to deliver meaningful and unique experiences with our events” continue the trio of founders.
