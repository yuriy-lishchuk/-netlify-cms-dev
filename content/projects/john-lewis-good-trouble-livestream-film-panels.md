**The Live Stream**

Mirrored Media continued our partnership with Participant Media and several of their community partners to facilitate a series of community livestream conversations around the release of John Lewis: Good Trouble. Partners for these events included Southern Coalition for Social Justice, All in Together, VoteRiders, African American Mayors Association, When We All Vote, and PushBlack. Attendees had the opportunity to hear from the film’s producers, members of Participant’s leadership and social impact teams, and community activists around the country.

The live streams began with a moderated panel, while audience members were encouraged to add their questions for the group to the website’s chat feature. After the panel, the moderator opened the floor for audience Q&A, where panelists tackled questions both as a group and as individuals with specific experience with the topics.

These live stream panels served as an interactive touchpoint within the impact campaign surrounding the film’s July 3rd release, called the Make Good Trouble Campaign. In partnership with the filmmakers, Participant, Magnolia Pictures, Color Farm Media, Fair Fight, VoteRiders, the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, and locally-led community groups, the campaign has hosted screenings nationwide to educate people around their voting rights and help get out the vote in their communities.

**About John Lewis: Good Trouble**

Using interviews and rare archival footage, John Lewis: Good Trouble chronicles Lewis’ 60-plus years of social activism and legislative action on civil rights, voting rights, gun control, health-care reform and immigration. Using present-day interviews with Lewis, now 80 years old, Porter explores his childhood experiences, his inspiring family and his fateful meeting with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1957. In addition to her interviews with Lewis and his family, Porter’s primarily cinéma verité film also includes interviews with political leaders, Congressional colleagues, and other people who figure prominently in his life.

The Good Trouble Campaign — at makegoodtrouble.com — aims to support communities impacted by voter suppression so that everyone can have equal and safe access to the ballot box this year. Makegoodtrouble.com houses resources to learn about voter suppression across the country and how to help combat it: including how to check your voter registration status, register to vote, apply for mail-in and/or absentee ballots and know your polling place.
