In September of 2017, Mirrored Media teamed up with the Los Angeles-based non-profit organization, Face Forward, to produce its annual fundraising gala at the Taglyan Complex in Hollywood. This year’s theme was “Arabian Nights”, which featured many Middle Eastern-inspired entertainment elements and decor.

Face Forward’s mission is to provide emotional and financial support for men, women, and children who have been victims of domestic violence, human trafficking, or other cruel criminal acts. Founders Deborah and David Alessi have have raised millions of dollars through Face Forward to give victims and survivors a fresh start with reconstructive surgery, housing, legal counsel, and more.

This year’s 8th Annual Gala, with 500 guests in attendance, began with happy hour on the beautifully manicured outdoor grounds of the Taglyan. This portion of the evening featured:
+ Live camel photo-opp
+ Sway pole performance
+ Arabian drummer
+ Belly dancers
+ 4-piece Arabian band
+ Snake charmer
+ Two step and repeats
+ Custom signage
+ Lamborghini and McLaren on display
+ Etihad Airlines flight attendant models
+ Specialty cocktails

Guests were invited to indulge in the tequila tasting bar, hookah & cigar lounges, and the henna tattoo station. Just inside the foyer, they could partake in a silent auction with a wide array of exciting prizes, such as signed sports memorabilia, luxury car rental, and high-end apparel.

The gala kicked off at 8pm, hosted by Entertainment Tonight’s Keltie Knight, and with voiceover narration by famed movie trailer voice, Ashton Smith. Face Forward presented awards to both Kelly Osbourne and Mel B for their continued contributions to the foundation, and also honored some of the recent patients who have benefited from Face Forward’s tireless efforts.

Guests were treated to a gourmet three-course meal along with top-shelf cocktails. Each table was adorned with five-foot-high floral centerpieces, while the ballroom itself had drapery, cascades, and jabots that were all in line with the gala’s Arabian theme. Between nominees and speakers, guests were treated to live performance art including an LED cyr wheel acrobat and traditional Arabian dance with a live snake.

The main focus of the evening, the live auction, was a resounding success. Renowned auctioneer Yve Rojas brought charisma, excitement, and compassion to this live auction in which guests were bidding on many prestigious items generously donated by our sponsors. Prizes consisted of flights to Africa, Beverly Hills shopping sprees, culinary adventures, and an all-inclusive vacation to The Maldives.  

After the auction concluded, it was time to party! Joe King of The Fray warmed up the crowd before Robin Thicke entertained guests with his smash hit, “Blurred Lines”, among others. Nick Rosen and Friends, the house band from Hollywood’s Sayers Club, closed out the night with an energetic 90-minute set.
