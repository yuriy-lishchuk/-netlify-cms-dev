## The Sabrina Carpenter Evolution Meet and Greets

Mirrored Media teamed up with Hollywood Records, Sabrina Carpenter, and Forever 21 to create three very special meet-and-greets for Sabrina Carpenter fans during the release of her sophomore album, EVOLution.  Fans were encouraged to bring in copies of their albums for autographs and met the pop star in front of a signature step-and-repeat. 

The events took place at three Forever 21 locations in San Diego, Orange County, and Los Angeles over the course of 2 days.
10/14 – San Diego Forever 21
10/15 – Orange County Forever 21
10/15 – Los Angeles Beverly Center Forever 21

The event gave Sabrina an opportunity to meet some of her most loyal and dedicated followers in the Southern California area and share in their excitement of the highly anticipated new album.  All who attended enjoyed listening to the album as they waited for their turn to meet Sabrina.  As an added bonus, the first 250 fans to arrive were greeted with specialty cupcakes designed to match the color scheme of EVOLution.

The weekend was a great success, with nearly 2,000 fans getting a chance to be up close and personal with Sabrina Carpenter.  For Sabrina, it was an especially monumental moment to experience, firsthand, the initial authentic reactions to the album.  Overall, Mirrored Media set out to create a series of environments that facilitated the celebration and sales of EVOLution while also giving Sabrina the opportunity to touch those who are most valuable to her success – the fans.
