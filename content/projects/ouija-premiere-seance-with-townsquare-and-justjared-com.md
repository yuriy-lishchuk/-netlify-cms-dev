Mirrored Media teamed up with Townsquare to work on the release for Universal Picture’s Halloween horror hit, Ouija.  The campaign consisted of the movie premiere, afterparty, and private seance experiences hosted by JustJared.com.
 
Mirrored Media worked with Townsquare and Just Jared to create and design a premiere event for the horror movie.  Guests were invited to the Hollywood Forever Cemetery to screen the movie within the Messianic Temple.  Following the screening, guests enjoyed an afterparty in the cemetery inclusive of food, drinks, and live entertainment.
 
During the afterparty, pre-selected guests were invited to the second floor of the Temple to partake in one of two traditional victorian seances. In the weeks leading up to the premiere, Mirrored Media engaged with several social influencers to create viral videos inviting fans to submit questions via twitter for the influencer to ask the spirits during the upcoming seance.  Thousands of fans tweeted questions for the stars to ask using the custom movie hashtag.
 
On-site at the event, guests entered a fabricated set featuring beautiful stained glass windows, bookshelves, candles, and a working fireplace.  The film’s cast and the influencers sat around a large table while invited guests and media sat in a viewing area.  Olivia Cooke, Daren Kagasoff, Ana Coto, Shelley Hennig, Bianca Santos, Emily Kinney, Big Time Rush‘s Kendall Schmidt, Her‘s Portia Doubleday, Vampire Academy‘s Dominic Sherwood, Jessie‘s Chris Galya, Pair of Kings‘ Ryan Ochoa, model Cameron Fuller, and actress Georgie Flores and some of their celeb friends were a select few in attendance. Rob Zabrecky, a renowned medium, lead the seance using a custom built Ouija board, matching the prop from the movie.  Social media questions were asked to the spirits, answered through the board, and live tweeted for fans around the world to follow.  Throughout the show, the spirits interacted with the room making guests jump, scream, and yell as candles levitated, books flew off shelves, glasses shattered, and tables shook from the spirits.  Hidden cameras throughout the room captured the audience’s reactions and caught all the magic taking place.
