To close out RTX, the convention’s creators, Rooster Teeth partnered with Kraken Rum to create a truly unique after-party for invited guests. The party was hosted at Driftwood Downtown, just steps from RTX’s location at the convention center. Mirrored Media managed creative and production for the project.

During the day, the Driftwood was transformed into a talent lounge as a nearby getaway from the hustle and bustle of the conference. The lounge was decked out in co-branded signage and featured an open Kraken bar and tacos for RTX talent to relax and refuel. At night, the real party began as the space was converted into the Rooster Teeth After-Party Presented by Kraken.

This event attracted a line around the block, where large-scale organic signage blended with the exterior brick wall of the venue. Inside, custom items included branded napkins, coasters, limited edition pins, signage, and decals of the sea creature’s tentacles. All three bars were wrapped with a realistic image of the Kraken creature’s tentacles coming up and over the bar.

Kraken imagery carried into the bathrooms, where tentacle decals covered the mirrors for a selfie photo moment. Kraken bottles that had been converted into lamps and custom gobos with the Rooster Teeth and Kraken logos lit the space as a DJ entertained guests while they sipped on curated Kraken rum cocktails from one of three bars.

Guests could step inside our photo booth, which featured a custom Rooster Teeth x Kraken overlay as well as a 3D element with the Kraken creature’s tentacles reaching out from behind the subject. All physical and digital assets were designed in black and white to seamlessly blend with the color scheme of all Kraken branding.

As guests ascended to the rooftop of the venue, they were met with an immersive stairwell where the Kraken creature was projection-mapped onto the wall. The lifelike sea creature blinked at onlookers as they passed by, then slowly the stairwell seemingly filled with water as bubbling ocean audio played, before fading to the Rooster Teeth and Kraken logos.

Upstairs on the roof we used unique light projection and integrated an existing wooden fence to create the illusion that the sea creature was living on the structure. 

The Rooster Teeth After-Party Presented by Kraken was an entertaining way to celebrate another successful year of RTX in Austin for both sponsors and attendees.
