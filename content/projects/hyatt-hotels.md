Hyatt Hotels Corporation announced it is “transforming the standard in-room television into a fully connected, interactive entertainment center and virtual concierge at its full-service properties across the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean.” Mirrored Media teamed up with Prescriptive Music and Hype Music to be the music supervisors and supply the background music for each Hyatt location. We aim to create the best experience for each guest from the moment they walk into the hotel.
