**The Campaign**

To promote season two of its turn-of-the-century crime drama, *The* *Alienist*, TNT partnered with several organizations whose legacies reach all the way back to the show’s setting of 1897 Manhattan in the Gilded Age.

The show, which is based on the best-selling books by Caleb Carr, stars Daniel Brühl (Rush), Dakota Fanning and Luke Evans as an unlikely trio who become a team of criminal investigators assembled by Theodore Roosevelt, who at the time served as police commissioner of New York City. Brühl plays brilliant criminal psychologist Dr. Lazlo Kreizler, who attended Harvard with Roosevelt and newspaper illustrator John Moore (Evans), who helps Kreizler with the investigation. Roosevelt also offers them the assistance of his secretary, Sara Howard (Fanning), who has known both Roosevelt and Moore since she was a child. In season one, the three work to track down a serial killer who is murdering street children.

In season two, *Angel of Darkness*, Howard has opened her own detective agency and she seeks the aid of Kreizler and Moore, now a *New York Times* reporter, after the infant daughter of the Spanish consular is kidnapped.

When it came time to promote season two, team TNT knew they wanted to focus on a few of the show’s key topics: it’s location in Manhattan as well as its emphasis on the era’s fashion and fine dining. Instead of bringing audiences into NYC’s Gilded Age, TNT brought a bit of the Gilded Age to them. One of the key pieces in the second season campaign is an elaborate, exquisitely produced mailer featuring products you might expect to find in the show’s world. Created in collaboration with brand partners that TNT’s VP of brand marketing Telmo Tabuas says “have lasted the test of time or capture the timeless spirit of New York City.” These custom boxes were sent out to fashion, entertainment, and lifestyle influencers who promoted the partnerships while encouraging their followers to tune in to the show’s premiere. Influencers included Heather Dubrow, Dorothy Wang, and Taye Hansberry.

**Delmonico’s**

One of the trio’s frequent haunts in the series is Delmonico’s Steakhouse in the Financial District, which opened in 1837. The restaurant still exists today, even though it’s been closed for indoor dining since quarantine due to coronavirus started in March. “Delmonico’s felt like it was the perfect partner because it’s a key character in the show,” said Telmo Tabuas, senior vice president of brand marketing, TNT, TBS and truTV.

To commemorate the season two premiere of “**The Alienist: Angel of Darkness**,” [TNT](https://www.tntdrama.com/) is giving back to the city that inspired the hit series. New York City, like many others, has been hugely impacted by COVID-19, and TNT is thanking those fighting on the frontlines to keep its residents healthy as well as giving to those who have been affected. 

“Everybody’s getting food delivered now, so we thought about partnering with a New York institute and delivering food to consumers in New York City,” said Tabuas.  TNT commissioned the historic dining institution and in-series on-location setting to open their doors for one day only to deliver meals specially prepared by their executive chef to hundreds of healthcare workers and the community that have been impacted by COVID-19. 

With the help of local partner [Feed the Frontlines NYC](https://www.feedthefrontlinesnyc.org/), the meal deliveries will feature a special three-course menu including select items that appeared on the show. The signature dishes include the classic BLT wedge salad, original Delmonico’s steak and rice pudding cake.

**Bergdorf Goodman**

To celebrate the award-winning costumes of The Alienist, TNT  joined forces with the iconic luxury institution, [Bergdorf Goodman](https://www.bergdorfgoodman.com/), to create a curated selection of merchandise inspired by the show’s costume design. Fans nationwide can immerse themselves in the series by shopping the merchandise online, and local New Yorkers can visit the flagship store to see a custom “The Alienist: Angel of Darkness” themed window display.

**Additional Partnerships**

TNT partnered with a number of other brands to celebrate the Season 2 premiere including Old Forester Bourbon, Death and Co, and D.S Fragrance. TNT and Old Forester partnered to release custom etched bottles of the distillery’s 1897 Bottled in Bond bourbon, an ode to Sara’s love of whiskey and the year 1897, the year the series is set. Using Old Forester bourbon, Death & Co. and TNT crafted 10 custom cocktails inspired by the three main characters in the drama with Sara’s Evening Ritual, Moore’s Lemonade, and Kreizler’s Glass cocktails all earning spots on the menu at the NY, LA and Denver hotspot for a limited time. Inspired by the world of The Alienist, TNT and D.S. & Durga released an exclusive unisex fragrance, First Light Five Boroughs, that captures NYC at the turn of the century through notes of mimosa, violet, chypre.
