Nordstrom celebrated their holiday ‘Make Merry’ campaign with a drive-in movie screening at The Grove on November 28th. The experience had a capacity of 150 vehicles and Nordstrom invited Los Angeles customers to enjoy a complimentary show. The drive-in highlighted curbside pick-up offerings from the department store, allowing guests to shop online ahead of the drive-in and have their items delivered straight to their cars after arriving at the rooftop venue of The Grove.

Upon arrival, guests were guided to a check-in station where they were welcomed with branded gift bags filled with movie snacks and Nordstrom staff was able to connect them with their orders. An oversized nutcracker and lighting matching the brand colors guided cars through a series of larger than life garland archways strung with Christmas lights, surrounded by oversize presents wrapped in the custom Make Merry wrapping paper and Nordstrom’s signature Scandanavian horse decor straight out of a holiday window display. Holograms displayed an animated gif of the Make Merry logo, with giant Christmas trees above, decorated in coordinated brand colors of pink, red and gold. This drive-through moment provided a beautiful and exciting photo moment, while keeping guests safely in their cars. 

Staff guided the cars to their safely distanced spots to enjoy the show and take in the sights of the experience as well as the panoramic views of Los Angeles from the eighth level structure. Projection mapping on the side of the structure and lighting brought the Make Merry campaign to life by converting a rooftop structure into an immersive experience. Guests of Nordstrom were treated to a screening of Netflix’s new movie The Christmas Chronicles 2, as servers in branded shirts and masks delivered hot cocoa to the parked cars and Nordstrom merry makers delivered online orders. Before the movie began, pre-show content played trivia and heartwarming holiday promotional content on the giant screen to entertain guests, while a live DJ emceed the experience and surprised a few lucky winners with a Nordstrom gift card raffle.
