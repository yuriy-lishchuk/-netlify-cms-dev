## SnowFest Returns to Park City Live with The Palms and Last Call

PARK CITY, Utah (November 12, 2018) – Centered at the 50-yard line of Main Street, Park City Live (PCL) was, once again, the pulse during this year’s Film Festival bringing the best in entertainment to Hollywood’s elite. Palms Casino Resort teamed up with Park City Live on Friday, January 25, Saturday, January 26 and Sunday, January 27 to present SnowFest 2019. In the midst of a $690M renovation that includes a state-of-the-art nightclub and dayclub, Palms collaborated with PCL to bring A-list performers, G-Eazy (January 25) Marshmello (January 26) and Above & Beyond (January 27) to kick off week one of the festival. Mirrored Media was Park City Live’s official production partner throughout the first weekend of the film festival.

PCL featured headlining artists, Diplo (January 24), followed by rap sensation Machine Gun Kelly (January 28), ZHU (January 31) and number one DJ in the world, Martin Garrix (February 1).

LAST CALL partnered with Park City Live, to create a LAST CALL lounge where guests could hangout and enjoy the hangover prevention drink. LAST CALL contains a combination of vitamins, plant extracts and electrolytes to help the body recover and replenish quickly. LAST CALL’s powerful formula is contained in a jewel-like bottle and multi-part cap that protects the active ingredients until the user breaks the seal and is ready to consume the drink. The innovative packaging system allows ingredients to be delivered at maximum potency without the use of chemical preservatives, mixing agents or pasteurization.

The Palms recently announced KAOS Dayclub & Nightclub which will consist of a fully integrated 73,000 square foot dayclub and 29,000 square foot nightclub and feature exclusive residencies with world-renowned musical artists including Above & Beyond, Cardi B, G-EAZY, Kaskade and Skrillex, opening early April 2019 as part of the ongoing $690M renovation.

When turning PCL into Kaos, we had extensive signage including full bar wraps, mezzanine wraps, stage signage, gobos, Lightbox entry signage, artist greenroom step and repeat, custom pillows for the tables, hanging 3d logos, and a custom immersive neon step and repeat Photo Booth.

Brody Jenner stopped by the first night of the collaboration which continued throughout the weekend with performances by Marshmello on January 26 and Above & Beyond on January 27.
