At Vidcon 2016, Mirrored Media produced two booths for Live.Me, one community booth and another for creators. Live.Me is the #1 social platform for broadcasting and watching live streaming videos.

Each of the booths had special guest appearances from top Live.Me influencers, as well as other social media influencers. With a host at each booth,  fans were able to engage in real time with the influencers for the viewers at Vidcon and at home. The booth visually included 5 large screens that were constantly streaming live original content that was being created by fans at home and at Vidcon. Fans also had the opportunity to play a variety of games to win prizes such as branded power banks, tripods, phone accessories, and sunglasses.

## ABOUT VIDCON |

One year’s VidCon attendee is the next year’s superstar. Entire genres are created in the time it takes a full season of TV to meander its way to conclusion. Creating an event for something so wildly diverse and rapidly evolving is an impossible task, but we attempt it anyway. And we do it with excitement, because we believe that online video is the most important cultural force since the motion picture. We are in the very early, defining moments of an extremely powerful global force. VidCon is and strives to continue to be the physical center of that revolution.
