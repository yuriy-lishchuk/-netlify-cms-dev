For 12 days, the 72nd edition of the Festival de Cannes has celebrated artists and films from different perspectives, making cinema a celebration of discovery and reunions shared all around the world. Tonight, on the stage of the Grand Théâtre Lumière, Édouard Baer, the Master of Ceremonies, welcomed the Feature Film Jury headed by Alejandro Gonzalez Iñárritu to announce the 2019 Awards. A look back in pictures.

The Festival de Cannes has remained faithful to its founding purpose: to draw attention to and raise the profile of films, with the aim of contributing towards the development of cinema, boosting the film industry worldwide and celebrating cinema at an international level. And to this day, this profession of faith constitutes the first article of the Festival regulations. In addition to the Selection, cinema lovers can also explore the world of cinema in a different way by attending masterclasses, tributes, or exhibitions which make up the events of an edition.

Since its June 2018 launch, Engineer.ai has empowered customers around the world to bring their ideas to life with the help of efficient, tailored software. Whether it’s a social app or e-commerce platform, the Builder.ai tool transcends the need for traditional tech know-how in the creation of each individual’s project.

This year at Cannes, Builder celebrated Rambo V with Sylvester Stallone and Millennium Films. We helped to host a star-studded dinner alongside a handful of directors, producers, executives and actors with Millennium Films. The “Builder x Millennium Films” partnership will continue with a custom platform for the media giant. 

Following the dinner hosted by , guests were joined by Festival invitees for an emotional tribute to Sylvester Stallone. “Sylvester Stallone’s Friday at the Cannes Film Festival ended with a honorary career retrospective of the Rocky and Rambo star, topped off with an early look at his upcoming Millennium Entertainment movie Rambo V – Last Blood, which he co-wrote.

Following a standing ovation (off which Stallone teared up) and an introduction by Cannes boss Thierry Frémaux, a sizzle reel fired off with Stallone’s gung-ho speech from the 1978 trucker union movie F.I.S.T.: “We’re going to go back out there, and they’re not going to beat us down no more, they’re not going to burn us down no more, they’re not going to shoot us down no more…” before getting the union members in a fevered shout “One Fist! One Fist!” The soundtrack lit up with Survivor’s Rocky III song “Eye of the Tiger” and the crowd clapped in unison, continuing through to Bill Conti’s Rocky theme “Gonna Fly Now”.” – Deadline

Rambo V: Last Blood is directed by Adrian Grunberg and produced by Millennium Films. The film stars Sylvester Stallone, Paz Vega and Oscar Jaenada. Matthew Cirulnik and Sylvester Stallone wrote the script based on characters created by David Morell. The film will be released in the US and worldwide from September 20. It will be distributed in France by Metropolitan Filmexport on October 8.
