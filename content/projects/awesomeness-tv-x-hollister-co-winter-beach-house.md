Highlighting their continued partnership into 2018, AwesomenessTV and Hollister teamed up with Mirrored Media to present the AwesomenessTV x Hollister Beach House. The February event, which took place at the end of Hollister Blvd. in Santa Monica, CA, brought to life Hollister’s mantra that every day is summer, no matter what time of year.

With a large invite-only Saturday beach party sandwiched between two days of AwesomenessTV filming, each of the three days had no shortage of exciting activities and beautiful visuals for influencers and guests alike.

Our teams worked in concert to truck-in four Hollister-branded shipping containers, two of which were custom two-story builds. One of these contained an open staging area on the bottom and a DJ booth up top. The focal point, dubbed the ‘Carpe Crate’, acted as the main entertainment stage and was outfitted with a wall that had the ability to open and close with the push of a button. Hollister and AwesomenessTV were able to build suspense behind the scenes and reveal a variety of surprises to guests throughout the duration of Saturday’s event, often with the help of moving head lights, a fog machine, and branded props. Another shipping container was delivered and custom-fitted on site to become a prime photo opportunity as an interactive ball pit. It contained lounge furniture, play balls, and branding throughout.

One of the most exciting elements for guests was the saltwater pool built within a shipping container; one of only a handful in North America. This custom pool was branded inside and out had a large glass window in front, allowing guests to capture one-of-a-kind images of their friends in the depths of the pool. Filled with roughly 2,000 brightly colored rubber ducks, it was one of the highlights of the weekend. Other activations throughout the space included a 30-foot inflatable water slide, a coloring wall with oversized crayons, an animal costume photo wall, and a collection of inner tube art installations.

The entire event space sat on sand and was surrounded by hedge walls, but even with the private enclosure, it still provided a visually-stunning landmark for those on the public beach, walkways, and bike paths. The hedge walls were covered with a variety of patterned inner tubes both inside and out. Our beach-facing pool exterior, which sat just inches away from the public bike path, was affixed with Hollister branding. The two-story shipping containers also featured an ode to Hollister’s marketing campaign, Carpe Now, which could be seen hundreds of yards away. As the sun set, we illuminated the space with custom neon lighting in addition to hanging string lights.   

The weekend’s focal point was Saturday’s beach party event that was open to exclusive invited guests. Attendees were treated to appearances from their favorite creators, all of whom were happy to take photos and interact throughout the day. Host Hunter March was joined by friends Alisha Marie, JonMarie Westengard, and a collection of influencers who encouraged fans to ‘Carpe Now’. Throughout the day, “House Party” would play over the speakers triggering the shipping container door to drop down and reveal surprises with talent. Highlights included a beach-inspired obstacle course, an exclusive performance by Mahogany Lox, a DJ set by Gryffin, pool jumping competitions, and a inflatable dinosaur dance party.  

The obstacle course allowed attendees to race against each other through several activations on the sand. We utilized existing elements such as the giant water slide, and added a slip & slide, water pool obstacles, and a finish line made up of roughly 30 inner tubes tied together that guests dove through as they finished.  

The most unexpected of surprises arrived near the end of the day when 20 puppies were introduced from within the Carpe Crate. Guests were able to hold, play with, and take photos with all of the cuddly pups as the day came to a close. Even with all the highlights, the puppy party was the day’s surefire hit.

Each day, the adjacent Perry’s Cafe provided food and drinks to all attendees, including a hot chocolate bar with SmashMallow brand marshmallows for s’more roasting, and a custom-branded ice cream cart.
