Fullscreen raised the bar at VidCon 2017, debuting the convention’s first ever double-decker booth. The elaborate build featured a large LED screen, a stage, and a viewing area in front where fans could get up close and personal to their favorite creators.

Each side of the booth presented a unique photo opportunity. On the left side was a Met Gala-inspired Boomerang booth with LED colored lights. The right side featured a large foliage wall with a custom neon sign. The wall had a new neon sign for each day of the convention, encouraging multi-day attendees to come back and experience the booth all over again.

The back of the booth featured the Flex Room Presented by AT&T. This area had three custom neon signs, a lounge, a marble wall, recessed lighting, and a phone charging station. Fans were able to tweet at a Twitter vending machine to get a variety of Fullscreen and AT&T-branded swag, including popsockets, phone chargers, sunglasses, bracelets, earbuds, and keychains. Brand ambassadors were also on hand distributing other free gifts.

The second floor contained the main control room and front-of-house for the whole booth. It also featured a green room area where talent could relax before taking the stage. This level gave creators a bird’s-eye view of the convention floor and allowed them to interact with fans before and after their official appearances.

The booth drew huge crowds during all hours of VidCon, drawing rave reviews from talent and fans alike.

## Movie Nights:

For the fourth year in a row, Mirrored Media teamed up with Fullscreen to present another successful round of Movie Nights, showing three highly-anticipated movies: Despicable Me 3, Power Rangers, and Cars 3.  These popular events, held in a large third floor ballroom of the convention center, drew crowds ranging from 400 to 1,800 people. Guests enjoyed the screenings by lounging in Fullscreen-branded air chairs. During the pre-release premiere of Despicable Me 3, the minions even came out to greet guests.

Several branded pull-up banners and step and repeats provided fans with the perfect photo opportunity. A raffle was held each night where a few lucky guests were able to win prizes like Disneyland tickets and Rokus.
