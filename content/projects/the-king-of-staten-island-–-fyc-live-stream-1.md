For the premiere of The King of Staten Island, Universal Pictures brought on Mirrored Media to help create a virtual way to engage with the film’s audiences. This live stream conversation included director Judd Apatow, Pete Davidson, Bel Powley, Marissa Tomei, Bill Burr, and Steve Buscemi, and was moderated by Jenelle Riley.

### Our Work:

* Live Q&A discussion following premiere
* Custom on-screen graphic

### Synopsis:

Scott (Pete Davidson) has been a case of arrested development ever since his firefighter father died when he was seven. He’s now reached his mid-20s having achieved little, chasing a dream of becoming a tattoo artist that seems far out of reach. As his ambitious younger sister (Maude Apatow) heads off to college, Scott is still living with his exhausted ER nurse mother (Marisa Tomei) and spends his days hanging with the guys and secretly hooking up with his childhood friend Kelsey (Bel Powley). But when his mother starts dating a loudmouth firefighter named Ray (Bill Burr), it sets off a chain of events that will force Scott to grapple with his grief and take his first tentative steps toward moving forward in life.

Co-starring Steve Buscemi and Pamela Adlon, *The King of Staten Island* is directed by Judd Apatow from a screenplay by Apatow, Pete Davidson and Dave Sirus. The film is produced by Apatow and Barry Mendel.

### Where to Watch:

The King of Staten Island is available on streaming with Amazon Prime.
