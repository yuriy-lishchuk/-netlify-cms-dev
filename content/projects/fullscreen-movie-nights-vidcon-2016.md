This year at Vidcon 2016 Mirrored Media produced three consecutive Movie Nights for Fullscreen. These evenings included exclusive looks at new trailers and original content, never before seen movie premieres and special guest appearances. Over 5,500 fans attended the three day event.

The movies premiered at Vidcon included “Lights Out,” “The Secret Life of Pets,” and “Nerve.” Special appearances included Emma Roberts, Andrea Russet, and Frankie Grande.

As soon as the doors opened to the screening room, fans rushed in and were greeted by beanbag chairs, branded popcorn and cups, making it a great evening with friends!

Thursday’s Movie Night was hosted by Rachel Scanlon and Jon Brence. Throughout the night, fans were introduced to sneak peaks, including a season premiere episode of “Jack & Dean of All Trades” and new Girls Night In content. The director of the short film “Lights Out,” David Sandberg, was also in attendance. Attendees then enjoyed the feature film, “Lights Out.” Once the film was over, the audience was surprised with a special Lights Out scare hallway!

On Friday Movie Nights began with a special show, “Writing with Grace,” which included an appearance and script reading by Grace Helbig and friends. The show was then followed by the premiere of “The Secret Life of Pets.” Following the film, Andrea Russett surprised fans and introduced her short film “SICKHOUSE.”

Saturday night featured the premiere of the movie “Nerve” starring Emma Roberts and Dave Franco. Hosted by Rachel Scanlon and Andy Riesmeyer, Saturday night included a variety of guest appearances including Frankie Grande, the cast of Making Moves, and Emma Roberts herself. Attendees not only got to see a exclusive preview of “Nerve” but they had the opportunity to place themselves in the film through a virtual reality experience!

We are excited that Fullscreen Movie Nights was a huge success!

## ABOUT VIDCON |

One year’s VidCon attendee is the next year’s superstar. Entire genres are created in the time it takes a full season of TV to meander its way to conclusion. Creating an event for something so wildly diverse and rapidly evolving is an impossible task, but we attempt it anyway. And we do it with excitement, because we believe that online video is the most important cultural force since the motion picture. We are in the very early, defining moments of an extremely powerful global force. VidCon is and strives to continue to be the physical center of that revolution.
