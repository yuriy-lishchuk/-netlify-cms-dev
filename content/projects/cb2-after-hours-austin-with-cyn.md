## CB2 Austin After Hours with CYN

For the September 2018 edition of CB2’s After Hours event series Stept and CB2 teamed up with Mirrored Media to create an exclusive in-store experience featuring singer/songwriter Cyn.

We were tasked with curating an intimate music venue within the confines of CB2’s Austin location inside the Domain Northside complex. The store shut its doors several hours early and by 8:30pm it had fully transformed into an exclusive live event space, including a 12’x16’ elevated stage. Lucky guests were admitted via a first-come-first-serve basis until the store reached capacity. An After Hours neon sign in the exterior window told them they had come to the right place.

Upon entering, they were guided down a long hallway with a custom neon sign and signature CB2 decor which led them to an expansive area of the store interior. Guests were invited to sip on cocktails from two open bars, courtesy of Revolution Spirits and Austin Eastciders, in this custom-lit space adorned with almost two dozen disco balls, staying in line with the After Hours aesthetic. Custom signage and decals were placed throughout the store. Austin DJ Edgar J kicked things off and got attendees pumped up as they browsed the store, talked with friends, and awaited Cyn’s exclusive performance.

Fans were also invited to create their own shareable photos in front of the custom photo wall. This backdrop featured an array of large and small disco balls, a decorative Roman statue, and colored lighting. Completing the visual was four unique kaleidoscope lens filters that guests were able to attach to their phones to capture the perfect photo.

Midway through the rainy evening, Cyn took the stage to a rousing ovation and delivered an impassioned 45-minute set backed up by her guitar player and drummer. After Cyn finished, DJ Edgar J kept the energy high until 11:00 pm when the event had to come to a close.
