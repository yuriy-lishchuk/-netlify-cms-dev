The Extreme Music team enlisted their officemates at Mirrored Media to produce a spooktacular Halloween party for their employees, clients, and colleagues. The event took place at the legendary Whisky A Go-Go on the Sunset Strip and brought a wide array of exciting and scary elements for the 666 costumed guests in attendance.

Extreme and Mirrored took over both the first and second floors as well as the outdoor section in back of the venue; each area presenting guests with a different vibe.

On the first level of the venue, the main stage was home to the evening’s feature performances, including DJ William Lifestyle and Extreme CEO Russell Emmanuel’s cover band, Courtesy Flush. A 3D ghost hologram hovered just near the stage, while other decor items like projection-mapped ghouls, witches, and spiderwebs hung throughout the venue. A snake charmer with a boa constrictor weaved in and out of the crowd, putting many attendees on edge. Towards the end of the night, a costume contest turned friends into enemies as they battled for the grand prize of a Hans Zimmer-signed guitar, and other prizes like PlayStation 4s.

The second level contained an elaborate haunted house build that presented guests with a terrifying photo-opp. After walking through an eerie front yard and into a small, creepy house, guests were presented with a gift box which they were instructed to open. Before they could, out jumped a creepy clown, a devilish little person, or a mangled amputee. Guests had their photo snapped at that moment for the perfect reaction shot, which they were encouraged to share via social media. It was all in good fun, though, as one lucky winner found a PlayStation 4 grand prize in the box.

The custom-lit outdoor area featured a hot dog cart, made-to-order tacos, and a creepy Ronald McDonald passing out McDonald’s burgers and fries. For those wanting a little break, they could take a seat with the Tarot card or palm readers. Party-goers could also try their hand at the adult-themed ring toss, which featured a cemetary build with severed body parts, knives, and gravestones.

The party was an exciting, uninhibited, celebratory, and fittingly terrifying start to the Halloween season.
