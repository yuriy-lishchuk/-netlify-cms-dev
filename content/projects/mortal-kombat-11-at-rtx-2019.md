# [WarnerMedia and Eleague team up for Mortal Kombat 11 esports tournament and Booth at RTX in Austin](https://venturebeat.com/2019/05/22/warnermedia-and-eleague-team-up-for-mortal-kombat-11-esports-tournament/)

WarnerMedia teamed up with Eleague to launch an esports tournament for Mortal Kombat 11. The tournament culminated at RTX Austin, Texas from July 5 to July 7.

Eleague broadcasted the tournament, and top-performing gamers won trips and a chance to win cash prizes in front of scores of fans at the venue in Texas, where Rooster Teeth held RTX — a gathering for animation, gaming, and comedy.

AT&T Fiber was the presenting sponsor of the activation at RTX that Mirrored Media produced dubbed, “the Eleague x MK 11 Arena at RTX Austin.”

The activation represented a first-of-its-kind deployment of WarnerMedia’s combined assets, platforms, brands and products across the video game and esports spaces, and featured an all-Warner melding of brands and interests. The activation featured 12 MK11 gaming stations for fans to play head to head, two featured screens, an AT&T Fiber activation, a charging lounge where spectators could watch the action, and an interactive photobooth where guests could be transformed into a MK11 fighter. Throughout the weekend, the space hosted the semi-finals of the tournament, free game play to fans, give aways, and featured surprise talent appearances by Rooster Teeth favorites to play against each other and fans. Guests had the opportunity to walk away with custom branded MK11 Kombat Koins, T-shirts, hats, desk mats, and more!

The lead up to the Eleague x MK 11 Arena at RTX Austin began with a series of six open online tournaments, each hosted by a top-ranked professional Mortal Kombat 11 player and ran on the Battlefy platform. The winner of each tournament earned a cash prize and a trip to RTX. Live coverage was broadcast on the EleagueTV Twitch channel as well as on TV on TBS.
