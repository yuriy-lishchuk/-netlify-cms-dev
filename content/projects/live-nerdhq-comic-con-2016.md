Mirrored Media worked with Live.me to team up with The Nerd Machine and their Nerd HQ event during San Diego Comic-Con. Live.me partnered with The Nerd HQ co-founders Zach Levi and David Coleman at the New Children’s Museum this year to help raise money for Operation Smiles and share exclusive content for fans. Nerd HQ guests and celebrities hung out on the Live.me greenroom couch to answer fan questions, play games, and raise money. One hundred percent of the proceeds raised were donated to Operation Smile which helps to give safe surgeries to children with facial deformities. We ran two live streams, one from the “Nerd HQ Conversations” and one from the greenroom. More than one hundred thousand people tuned in to the Live.me stream and thousands of dollars were raised over the course of the four days. TVs were placed throughout the space to showcase the live streams and allow fans to catch the exclusive moments from the Live.Me greenroom.
Guest Highlights Included:
+ Jared Padalecki from Supernatural
+ Tom Hiddleston from Thor
+ Jai Courney from Suicide Squad
+ Rober Kazinsky from World of Warcraft
+ Kumail Nanjiani – Silicon Valley
