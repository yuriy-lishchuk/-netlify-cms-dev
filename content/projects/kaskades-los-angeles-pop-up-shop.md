Mirrored Media, was tapped to produce multi Grammy® nominated singer, songwriter, and music producer Kaskade’s special Pop Up Shop to Los Angeles the week prior to his landmark SOLD OUT performance at the Los Angeles Convention Center on May 7th.

The Pop Up shop will host performances from local DJs and feature exclusive Kaskade merchandise including t-shirts, hats, bandanas, tote bags, and more. Additionally, fans will be able to purchase exclusive photography from Mark Owens and merchandise from Kaskade’s Imperial Motion Capsule Collection.

“We are beyond thrilled to have the opportunity to bring Kaskade’s vision to life. The concept was to bring fans together and celebrate the career of one of the world’s most famous EDM pioneers,” said Justin Lefkovitch, Founder and CEO of Mirrored Media.

Mirrored Media teamed up with Kaskade to create the pop up shop experience that Kaskade envisioned – this included everything from finding the perfect venue to designing the atmosphere and layout within the store. Mirrored Media worked closely with Kaskade and his team to ensure that all elements of the pop up shop were precisely what Kaskade imagined.

Kaskade’s Pop Up Shop will be located at 410 N. Fairfax Ave in Los Angeles and will be open from Tuesday, May 3rd through Saturday, May 7th between 12:00p – 8:00p. True to Kaskade form, fans should expect the man himself to stop by the store throughout the week.

Kaskade’s highly anticipated May 7th performance at LACC sold out immediately, selling over 20,00 tickets. The show, produced by Insomniac, will be the largest solo headlining live date of Kaskade’s career and the first dance music event to take place in the Convention Center’s 45-year history.

**ABOUT KASKADE**

Grammy nominated American recording artist, DJ, and producer Kaskade has remained at the forefront of the dance music world for more than a decade.  Creating a career of unprecedented milestones, Kaskade is the first U.S. DJ to secure a Las Vegas residency, the first solo electronic dance artist to sell-out Barclays Center, as well as the first dance artist to sell-out Navy Pier and the Staples Center. Just as comfortable playing packed clubs deep into the night as he is headlining the major festivals around the world, 2015 marked Kaskade's return to the iconic two-weekend Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, where his main stage appearance drew the two largest crowds in the storied sixteen-year existence of the festival.  Taking nothing away from his legendary live shows, Kaskade has always maintained that it's the songwriting that comes first, and his nine artist albums and five Grammy nominations back up that claim. Kaskade's latest album _Automatic_ was released in Fall of 2015 and has been streamed over 44.4M times on Spotify since release.
