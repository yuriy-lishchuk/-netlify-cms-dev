Mirrored Media and the Anaheim Marriott joined forces to create a memorable experience for hotel guests and fans through The Anaheim Sessions – a monthly showcase featuring a variety of independent artists and performers inside nFuse Bar & Kitchen at the Anaheim Marriott.

From 9pm to midnight concertgoers enjoy free entertainment, while indulging on a variety of Chef’s signature items – goat cheese spread with Anaheim chili jam, fish tacos with house made slaw, a prime rib dip and much more! They also can kick back and relax while enjoying drinks from the nFuse Bar, which features top shelf wines, hand crafted cocktails, twenty-four craft beers on draft and sixty-five different bourbons!

Check out some of the artists who have played sessions at the Anaheim Marriott below:
