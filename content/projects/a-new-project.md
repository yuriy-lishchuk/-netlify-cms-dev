We worked with TBS to partner with Buffalo Wild Wings to debut the GO-BIG Bundle in anticipation of the upcoming series premiere of GO-BIG SHOW.

In order to promote the January 7th premiere of GO-BIG SHOW, the most extreme talent competition ever, TBS has partnered with nationwide CDR juggernaut, Buffalo Wild Wings, to create the GO-BIG BUNDLE. The bundle features 20 traditional wings, 20 boneless wings, and fries for just $39.99.

To build awareness and anticipation for the upcoming series hosted by Bert Kreischer alongside celebrity judges Snoop Dogg, Jennifer Nettles, Rosario Dawson, and Cody Rhodes, consumers nationwide are able to order the Go-Big Show Wing Bundle by placing an order on [BuffaloWildWings.com](http://buffalowildwings.com/) or by ordering through the Buffalo Wild Wings app from January 2nd through the season finale on March 11th.
