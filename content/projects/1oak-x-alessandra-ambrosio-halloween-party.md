Halloween is notorious for some of the biggest and most extravagant parties of the year, especially in Los Angeles. Darren Dzienciol, partner at Hollywood’s celeb hotspot 1OAK, enlisted Mirrored Media to help produce the city’s hottest Halloween party of the season. Sponsored by Mene 24k and hosted by Victoria’s Secret supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio, Mo Al Turki, Tommy Chiabra, and Dzienciol, this star-studded bash hosted upwards of 500 celebrity guests at Club James, a lavish compound in Beverly Hills owned by millionaire mogul James Goldstein. The party featured special DJ performances by Alesso, Tyga, and DJ Snake, among others.

Upon entering the picturesque property, party-goers stopped at the outdoor courtyard area that featured a pumpkin-themed step and repeat with four shelves of carved and lighted pumpkins for the perfect photo opp. Each custom-carved jack-o-lantern spelled out the names of the party’s sponsors and hosts, including Mene, Ale, Darren, Mo, and Tommy. There was eerie Halloween lighting, made-to-order wood-fired pizza, and a premium cocktail cart provided by BTL SVC.

Inside the house, which boasted stunning views of Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean, guests were treated to a large LED wall, a custom laser show, fog machines, candles, Halloween candy, and a wide array of decor and accents featuring skeletons, ghouls, and zombies. The open bar served specialty cocktails on behalf of Casamigos tequila.

The party became the most coveted invite of the night, as it reached capacity after just a few hours and raged on well into the early morning hours. Notable guests included The Chainsmokers, Tyga, Courtney Love, Paris Hilton, Chuck Liddell, Alesso, G-Eazy, Halsey, Tobey Maguire, and many more.
