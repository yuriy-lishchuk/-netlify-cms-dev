On July 7th, Hollywood Records recording artist Sabrina Carpenter released her single “Why” as a followup to last year’s Evolution and 2015’s Eyes Wide Open.  To celebrate the release and generate more hype for “Why,” Mirrored Media created a unique two-day pop up experience at Santa Monica Place with a custom built, LED lit photo booth.  For 2 days, from 10am until 10pm, fans and passersby were encouraged to hop in the booth for an epic photo experience with friends and family while they danced along to “Why,” which played around the booth throughout the day.  Because of the booth’s unique design and the allure of the color changing LED strips, many of those who just happened to be frequenting the mall those days were enticed to take part in the activation, many of whom were not even familiar with Sabrina and her music.  Using the hashtag #SabrinaWhy, fans were able to share their photo booth experience and continue to spread the word about the song.
