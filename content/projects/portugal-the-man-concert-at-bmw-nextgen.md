BMW and Mirrored Media partnered at the brand’s inaugural #NEXTGen Conference in Munich to create a larger than life high-tech musical evening featuring 2018 #RoadToCoachella artist, Portugal. The Man. The audience of this once in a lifetime performance was comprised of an exclusive group of friends of the brand, creating an intimate and unique concert experience. Held in the revered Doke (Double Cone) on the sprawling BMW Welt campus in Munich, Germany, the performance featured members of the multi-platinum band, a video message from Khalid, and was hosted by Hans Zimmer, all former #RoadtoCoachella artist partners. The musicians broke traditional stage arrangements by sitting in a circle facing each other, rather than the audience, similar to the way the band would casually jam and write music. PTM wanted to bring the audience into their creative circle and give a glimpse into how they write their music. This in-the-round set up was positioned on a cement stage rising out of the ground.

To add grandeur, the performance featured a mounted camera in the center of the stage on a robotic motor which slowly panned in a 360* motion to capture each band member as they performed. The images from the camera were mixed with the band’s pre-existing graphics and displayed on a 20’ wide LED wall, which hugged the stage. The band’s involvement further extended past the stage with their 2018 road to Coachella vehicle which was on display outside the Doke during the event as well as during the Influencer Day at #NEXTGen. Portugal. The Man, along with Hans Zimmer and Khalid, began their partnership with BMW through the #RoadtoCoachella campaign, and has since continued to work together on collaborative work that represents both the spirit of the brand and the band.
