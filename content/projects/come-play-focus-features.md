For the premiere of Come Play, Focus Features worked with us to create a unique live stream conversation with panelists immediately following the digital premiere. Invited guests were able to watch the world premiere digitally and then join a conversation moderated by film critic Scott Mantz, featuring writer/director Jacob Chase, and stars Gillian Jacobs, John Gallagher Jr, and Azhy Robertson.

What made the experience truly unique and fun for Halloween were surprise “Easter eggs” throughout the panel. Just as Larry reveals himself to characters through their devices in the movie, audiences saw small glimpses of Larry in his mask throughout the panel in the background of Jacob’s room. As Scott was thanking the panelists and audience, Jacob’s room was noticeably empty with no response. The suspenseful score from the film began to play with still no signs of Jacob. Viewers then got a surprise scare from Larry on their screens, sure to make those at home jump!

To build awareness and anticipation for the upcoming series hosted by Bert Kreischer alongside celebrity judges Snoop Dogg, Jennifer Nettles, Rosario Dawson, and Cody Rhodes, consumers nationwide are able to order the Go-Big Show Wing Bundle by placing an order on [BuffaloWildWings.com](http://buffalowildwings.com/) or by ordering through the Buffalo Wild Wings app from January 2nd through the season finale on March 11th.
