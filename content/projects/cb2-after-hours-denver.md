Last week CB2 continued it’s fourth consecutive year of the in-store concert series “After Hours.” The event takes place after the store has closed, transforming the furniture store into an immersive music experience. “After Hours is a series of live musical experiences designed to support and share the artists who inspire us,” Lizzy Schofding explains.

They kicked off this year’s series with musical artist Kimbra in Denver, Colorado, and more recently featured Hanni El Khatib in Scottsdale, AZ. The team transformed the store into a tropical neon paradise designed and produced by Stept Studios and Mirrored Media respectively, bringing together influential interior designers and fans alike.
