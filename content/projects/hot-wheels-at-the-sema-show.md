The 2019 Hot Wheels Legends Tour wowed 90,000+ gearheads at 20+ events around the globe, in search of the ultimate custom car design. Heads turned and heats pounded as the tour rolled into the SEMA Show in Las Vegas on November 5 for the final lap of this international showdown.

Mattel brought in Mirrored Media to bring their vision to life with the Hot Wheels Pavilion at SEMA. Mirrored was tasked with creating a presence for Hot Wheels in the SEMA platinum lot, among many other sizable auto brands. The Hot Wheels Pavilion featured a two-story booth, display wall of diecast Hot Wheels cars, a Dickey’s framed race jacket, branded photo moments, live painting, and a massive Hot Wheels race track. Above the space, the Hot Wheels flag flew alongside the flags of Mexico, Germany, and the United States, representing the finalists in this year’s Legends Tour.

Along the sides of the Hot Wheels Pavilion, the 20 life-size finalist cars from the 2019 Legends Tour were displayed for attendees and judges to view. Also on display were the 5 previous winners who had already joined the Hot Wheels Garage of Legends, and had their cars turned into real diecast Hot Wheels cars.

The programming schedule featured meet & greets with exciting and relevant influencers from the auto space, including Supercar Blondie, Tanner Fox, Sidney Hoffmann, and Collete Davis. After participating in the Legends Tour as a judge, Jay Leno took the stage to announce the 2019 winners and officially induct them into the Hot Wheels Garage of Legends!

The panel of judges for the Hot Wheels Legends Tour included industry celebrities like Jay Leno, Richard Rawlings, comedian Adam Carolla, and racecar driver Collette Davis. Motortrend’s Editor-in-Chief, Edward Loh, and Larry Wood, Hot Wheels Designer since 1969, were also in the lineup.

The 15 finalists were judged based on three main categories: authenticity, creativity, and garage spirit. In other words, the winning car naturally looks like a Hot Wheels diecast in full-size form, was built and not bought, and is a brainchild with never before seen characteristics.

A custom ’57 Nash Metropolitan, built by best friends Greg Salzillo and Dave Ford, has been crowned the winner of the second annual Hot Wheels Legends Tour, the world’s largest international traveling car show. Their one-of-a-kind build will be immortalized as an iconic Hot Wheels 1:64 die-cast car, hitting stores nationwide in 2020!

The epic announcement was made at the 2019 SEMA Show in Las Vegas. A team of celebrity judges and Hot Wheels designers selected “The Nash” from almost 5,000 entries for its embodiment of Hot Wheels’ challenger spirit and legendary design!
