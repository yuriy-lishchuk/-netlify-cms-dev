In order to highlight BMW’s partnership and employee discount program with First American Trust, Mirrored Media teamed up with the automotive giant to present an exclusive activation for FA team members at their Santa Ana, CA location. The BMW Premier Partner Experience gave guests an opportunity to learn more about, and even test drive, several models from the X Series, M Series, and BMW’s line of hybrid/electric vehicles, the i Series.

From 10am – 3pm, registered employees were able to stop by the activation, located on a large portion of the campus’ parking lot, and become fully immersed in the BMW brand. Upon entering, guests were given BMW-branded reusable water bottles provided by S’well. They were greeted with two standout BMWs on display: a beautiful orange i8, and a luxurious white X3, both sitting on custom on-brand platforms. Employees were invited to take a seat inside each car, while BMW Product Specialists were on hand to offer more information and assistance. Guests were also invited to step into the photo booth, which featured a co-branded First American Trust /BMW step and repeat.

A large branded BMW semi-truck provided a backdrop for the VIP lounge. Located adjacent to the truck, and covered by a large BMW canopy, this carpeted area featured several perks for employees to enjoy, including:
+ Donuts provided by Voodoo Donuts
+ Gourmet coffee bar
+ Hint water
+ Two TVs featuring branded content
+ White lounge furniture
+ Floral decor and planters
+ Sound system with music

The highlights of the activation were the three driving experiences, which took place atop an adjacent parking garage on the FA campus. Guests had the opportunity to get behind the wheel of one of 13 BMWs, including the i3, M2, M4 Convertible, X5, 530e, or X6, for an exclusive test drive in one of three scenarios:
+ Accel/Decel: Drivers accelerate rapidly then hit the brakes on a closed course
+ Slalom: Drivers hug tight corners between cones on a closed course
+ iPerformance Accel/Decel: Drivers accelerate rapidly in a hybrid/electric BMW then hit the brakes on a closed course.

All cars were affixed with BMW Premier Partner Experience decals.

BMW subsidiary, MINI, also had its own footprint within the space, providing a relaxing camping vibe with turf, lawn chairs, Additional perks included:  
+ Branded mugs
