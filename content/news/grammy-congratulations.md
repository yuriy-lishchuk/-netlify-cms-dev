We have had the pleasure to work with some incredible artists this last year.  A very warm congratulations to a handful of them on their Grammy wins and nominations; Imagine Dragons, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, Zedd, Pretty Lights, Alabama Shakes, Gary Clark Jr, Vampire Weekend, The Civil Wars and Capital Cities.  Also a very large congrats to our friend Pharrell on his huge wins. Way to rock it!
