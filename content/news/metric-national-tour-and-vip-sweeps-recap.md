Indie rock band, Metric, hit the road this fall with the Acura ILX. In addition to ILX's presence at Metric's national tour, Acura gave some lucky sweepstakes winners VIP tickets to a Metric concert. Winners were driven to and from the concert in style in the new Acura ILX. In addition, winners met the band and received official band merchandise as a part of the promotion.
