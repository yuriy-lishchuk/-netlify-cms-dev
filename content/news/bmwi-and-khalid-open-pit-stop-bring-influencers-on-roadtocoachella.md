**Munich**. BMW i is once again one of the official partners of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2019. For the last two years, BMW i has been building up to the festival on social media with [**#RoadtoCoachella**](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/roadtocoachella/) and is also showcasing a unique Coachella design for its BMW i models. The striking look featuring flames and the image of a wolf is inspired by the current album cover of global superstar Khalid.

"The variety of live concerts at Coachella Festival is a great playground for creativity. At Coachella, the internationally most famous stars of the industry meet the most enthusiastic audience. Innovation and inspiration are the values that BMW i shares with the iconic festival, making it an ideal partner. We look forward to working with the festival and Khalid, one of the most exciting artists of contemporary soul music and a passionate BMW driver“, says Stefan Ponikva, Head of BMW Brand Experience Shows & Events.

> "I love road-tripping, hopping in my car and driving back home to El Paso is 12 hours each way from LA. To me, BMW, especially BMW i8, is the embodiment of freedom on the road. I really feel like a free spirit when I’m driving and listening to music."

Khalid is one of the most popular artists of his generation. It is therefore no surprise that Khalid is one of the headline acts at the upcoming Coachella festival. He inspired the festival fleet of vehicles for BMW i based on the cover of his new album ‘Free Spirit’. The Road to Coachella embodies the Free Spirit mentality of a fun road trip with friends to one of the greatest music festivals.

Some of the best-known international names will travel to the venue with BMW i a day before the festival begins to experience the design of the BMW i Coachella fleet for themselves and to explore Palm Springs. Follow the hashtag [**#RoadtoCoachella**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RoadToCoachella?src=hash) to virtually join Paris Hilton, Lena Gercke, Laura Marano and other influencers.

In addition to the actual festival programme, there is also something special in store for fans of Khalid. Together with BMW i, the singer will open a ‘Pit Stop’, where exclusive merchandise will be available for purchase. BMW of Palm Springs (3737 E Palm Canyon Dr, Palm Springs, CA 92264 USA) will be transformed into a must see fan experience away from the festival site with music, a food truck and other lifestyle initiatives. Khalid will announce the exact opening times himself on social media. 

The creative design interpretation of BMW i electric vehicles reflects the special, diverse spirit of the festival. Coachella is once again taking place at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. BMW i is supporting the event over the entire period from 12 to 21 April 2019. Almost 200 acts will thrill thousands of international visitors over the two weekends.

Mirrored Media is proud to partner with both BMW i and Khalid to bring this collaboration to life for Coachella 2019. Follow #RoadtoCoachella on social media to see the fleet head to Indio for both weekends of Coachella.
