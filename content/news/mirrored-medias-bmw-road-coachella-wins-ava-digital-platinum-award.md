Mirrored Media is honored to announce that our BMW Road to Coachella campaign has won a Platinum AVA Digital Award.

AVA Digital Awards honors the evolving ways and means that we engage our audiences through the creative convergence of digital arts, technology and information. The foundation for the Awards began in 1994 as a celebration of the audio-visual arts. Over the years, AVA’s categories changed to recognize the expanding role that digital media and the web were playing in the transfer of information. Now, through the internet and digital’s interactive capabilities, communication professionals are no longer just pushing their messages, they are responding to the user’s actions to provide information when, where and however they want it.
