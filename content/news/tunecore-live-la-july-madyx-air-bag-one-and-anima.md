At TuneCore Live, the party never stops. We have just announced the lineup for July's TuneCore Live! Performing at the Bardot in Hollywood on July 29th, [MADYX](http://www.madyx.com/), [Air Bag One](https://www.facebook.com/AIRBAGONE), and [ANIMA!](https://www.facebook.com/ANIMA.worldwide?fref=ts) will keep us dancing through the night. Each artist and band has an infectious sound full of synths and swagger. It will be a sight to behold.
