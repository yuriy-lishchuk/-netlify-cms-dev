TuneCore, the powerhouse independent digital music distribution and music publishing administration service, stepped up its presence in Austin this year with the official launch of [DropKloud](http://www.dropkloud.com/), an innovative, free app that gives fans VIP access to exclusive artist-curated Kloud content. This unique platform allows fans at SXSW to pick up Klouds from their favorites artists, giving them pre-release tracks, exclusive videos and photos.

DropKloud uses geo-fencing technology, which lets artists drop "Klouds" of exclusive content for their fans to experience at designated locations. Artists and partners curated special Austin-only content for fans, like never-before-heard tracks, behind the scenes video clips and exclusive photos. Fans received new Klouds every day in Austin during the SXSW music festival.  Download the free DropKloud app from the [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id971251828?mt=8) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tunecore.dropkloud&hl=en).

Mirrored Media teamed up with TuneCore and DropKloud to activate Klouds throughout Austin, as well as participate in multiple showcases including [Nettwerk 30thAnniversary Party at SXSW 2015 @ Maggie Mae's](http://live.tunecore.com/post/113185372907/nettwerk-30th-anniversary-party-at-sxsw-2015)  [Brooklyn Vegan Day Parties @ Red 7](http://live.tunecore.com/post/113185350632/brooklyn-vegan-day-parties-wednesday-march-19) [TuneCore Live: Austin @ Vulcan Gas Company](http://live.tunecore.com/post/113185442767/tunecore-live-austin-friday-march-20th-11-30-a-m) [CraveOnline Presents @ Vulcan Gas Company](http://live.tunecore.com/post/113185331997/craveonline-presents-saturday-march-21-2015)

DropKloud also released the debut episodes of Convenience Store Sessions, a new web series TuneCore created in partnership with Swisher Sweets that provides an up-close and personal look at TuneCore Artists and their music. The initial episodes feature FMLYBND and Olivver the Kid.
