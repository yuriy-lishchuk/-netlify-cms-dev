The sixth annual tech conference came to Toronto for the first time, bringing celebrity speakers, a women-focused tech program, and interactive sponsor activations.

The annual Collision tech conference, which has grown to be one of the biggest events in North America for tech entrepreneurs, made a major move for its sixth edition this year. The event traveled to Toronto, marking the first time the conference took place outside of the U.S.

Held May 20 to 23, the conference drew 25,711 attendees from 125 countries to the [Enercare Centre](https://www.bizbash.com/venue-directory/conference-centers-convention-centers-auditoriums/auditoriums/venue/13395915/enercare-centre) at Exhibition Place. Conference organizers worked with the City of Toronto, Tourism Toronto, and Exhibition Place to make the first Canadian edition happen.

Collision, which has been named one of BizBash’s [most innovative meetings](https://www.bizbash.com/corporate/media-gallery/13483266/most-innovative-meetings-2018-8-collision-conference), provided an opportunity to showcase the thriving Toronto tech scene. According to [the City of Toronto](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-city-of-toronto-welcomes-the-first-of-three-collision-technology-conferences-837295829.html), the Toronto region is the largest tech sector in Canada and the fourth largest in North America, employing 300,000 people in 24,000 companies. This year's Collision is the first of three that will take place in Toronto as part of the conference's agreement with the city. Through 2021, the City of Toronto expects the conference to draw around 90,000 people and have an estimated economic impact of $147 million in the region. Collision is part of a series of technology conferences that include Web Summit in Europe and Rise in Hong Kong.

On the activation floor, [Mirrored Media](https://www.bizbash.com/supplier-directory/event-meeting-planning-marketing-pr/event-planning-marketing-firms/supplier/13458422/mirrored-media) produced an activation for Builder by Engineer.ai, which helped facilitate conversations with customers in three different ways: mass communication, intimate conversations, and individual sales meetings. The two-story structure included two open meeting spaces and five private meeting rooms with computers and screens.
