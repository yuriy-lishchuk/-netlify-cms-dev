### Dive Brief:

TNT is partnering with a number of iconic businesses in New York City to promote the second season of "The Alienist: Angel of Darkness," the company shared via press release with Marketing Dive.

TNT helped open Delmonico's, an eatery prominently featured in the series, and paid for executive chef Billy Oliva to cook hundreds of meals to deliver to local healthcare workers through organization Feed the Frontlines NYC. Additionally, the brand partnered with legendary department store Bergdorf Goodman to curate a line of apparel inspired by the series, available online. The department store also created a themed window display with experiential agency Mirrored Media.

Old Forester and TNT created create custom etched bottles of the distillery's 1897 Bottled in Bond bourbon. Death & Co. worked with TNT to develop custom cocktails inspired by the show's three main characters, drinks that are now on the menu at the select bars for a limited time. Additionally, TNT and D.S. & Durga released an exclusive unisex fragrance, First Light Five Boroughs, inspired by the city at the time of the show.

### Dive Insight:

The television network is looking to use the show's setting of New York's 19th century Gilded Age to help promote the new season of "The Alienist: Angel of Darkness." These kinds of extensive product partnerships offer content producers an opportunity to push new shows through co-branded efforts that may appeal to the show's loyal fans.

TNT has made a handful of partnerships with iconic New York City businesses that are designed to get people talking about the show and drive sales at these businesses. The TV network has an opportunity to get its show in front of new audiences through in-person and online marketing with these local New York tie-ins. The Bergdorf Goodman partnership, for example, could encourage shoppers of the special apparel collection or drinkers at the Death & Co. bar to discover the show or explore the new season.

On the flip side, fans of the show may go to these businesses to seek out unique products as a fun way to more deeply engage with the series. This may be particularly impactful right now as many businesses in New York and elsewhere are struggling from pandemic shutdowns.

TNT follows other video content brands that have used marketing partnerships to promote shows. [Netflix teamed with Ben & Jerry's](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/ben-jerrys-launches-ice-cream-into-stratosphere-for-netflix-tie-in/578655/) and launched ice cream into the stratosphere to promote comedy series "Space Force." The ice cream brand filmed the launch and created a video to promote the special Boots on the Moon flavor and the show. Unilever brand Axe partnered with the [Netflix show "Sex Education"](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/axe-teams-with-netflixs-sex-education-to-offer-dating-tips/571637/) in February to initiate conversations around dating-related subjects that teen boys struggle with.
