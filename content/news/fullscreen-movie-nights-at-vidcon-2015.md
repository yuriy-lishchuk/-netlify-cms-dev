Fullscreen made waves in the digital space at this year’s VidCon! While creating opportunities for fans to connect with social media superstars, it also partnered with major film studios to create a personal movie night experience.

Mirrored Media worked with Fullscreen to throw a Movie Night for all three days of VidCon. Over 1000 fans lined up early every night in our AT&T Blue Room to take pictures with YouTube stars and grab free swag courtesy of Epix, Showtime, and HBO. As soon as the doors opened to the screening room, fans rushed in and were greeted by beanbag chairs, popcorn, and endless cups of Dr. Pepper Cherry, making for the perfect evening out with friends!

During Thursday’s Movie Night, YouTube all-stars Dylan Dauzat and Andrea Russett stopped by Movie Night to pump up fans with the trailer debut of _Electra Woman & Dyna Girl_ as well as the first film of the weekend, _Pixels_ in 3D.

On Friday night, Movie Night attendees rumbled around in VR chairs and Oculus Rift headsets for a virtual reality experience before heading into the screening of _Insurgent_. Fans were also paid visits from Brittani Louise Taylor, Acacia Brinley, and the cast members of Summer Break, who all also presented sneak peeks of upcoming films _The Outfield_ and _Mockingjay Part 2_.

On Saturday night, fans walked into an exclusive screening of M. Night Shyamalan’s new movie _The Visit_, which is out to the rest of the public on September 11th. On this final Movie Night, Bratz assembled a themed photobooth so that fans could create photo strips with their friends to remember the end of an jam-packed VidCon weekend. Once everyone gathered in the screening room, the attendees were also surprised with guest stars such as Jus Reign, Luke Korns, and The Fine Bros.

We are excited that Fullscreen Movie Nights was a huge hit!
