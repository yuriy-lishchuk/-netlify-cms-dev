## Mirrored Media Wins Two Summit Marketing Effectiveness Awards

**Mirrored Media** is excited to announce that we are double winners for the 2018 **Summit Marketing Effectiveness Awards**. Our BMW i Road to Coachella campaign was chosen for platinum for social media and silver for online advertising and marketing.

The Summit Marketing Effectiveness Award responds to a common need in the marketing and advertising sector: to acknowledge the contribution of results and messaging, and the achievement of the marketer’s business goals. The Summit Marketing Effectiveness Award is unique to other award programs because it reinforces that the goal of marketing communications is to change, influence or reinforce a audience's knowledge, attitudes, or beliefs. Using this premise as a basis for its judging criteria, the competition is becoming a true arbiter of marketing communication effectiveness. During the 2017 event, judges analyzed submissions and selected only 6% to receive the top spots. A truly international competition, the Summit Marketing Effectiveness Award received submissions from the following thirteen countries including Australia, Canada, Denmark, England, Germany, India, Nigeria, Singapore, Republic of Korea, South Africa, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and the United States.

“Marrying creativity and effectiveness can be a difficult task, so winning a Summit MEA is a significant achievement.” Said Jocelyn Luciano, Executive Director for the Summit Awards. “The combination of experienced judges and our tough criteria ensures that only deserving submissions receive Summit MEA recognition.” 

The Summit Awards organization is dedicated to furthering excellence in the communications industry. It administers three distinguished award competitions throughout the year with the goal of raising the awareness of companies and individuals who have the creative and marketing talent to go beyond the ordinary.

Throughout its 25-year history, the organization has established itself as one of the premier arbiters of communication excellence. Using stringent evaluation criteria and blind judging processes, its competitions reward only those firms whose work exemplifies the best in their class. Companies from all over the world invest their promotional dollars for the opportunity to be recognized as a Summit Award winner. The organization conducts three awards each year: Summit Creative Award, Summit Emerging Media Award and Summit Marketing Effectiveness Award.
