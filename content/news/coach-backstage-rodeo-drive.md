Back in September, Coach started a new initiative called Coach Backstage, a project focused on emerging musicians. Along with a website dedicated to listing new talents — complete with a short and sweet bio of each artist, the latest news updates about them, a playlist of their most popular songs, and links to their social media sites — the American fashion brand also hosts a series of concerts.

Mirrored Media is excited to announce that we will be working with Coach for its next concert, linked to the new store on Rodeo Drive. Coach has enlisted a pair of equally cool and talented musicians to perform for its Backstage series: Kid Cudi and Skylar Grey. The performers will hit the stage tomorrow evening celebrating Coach's reopening of its Rodeo Drive boutique in Beverly Hills.
