On July 7th, Hollywood Records recording artist Sabrina Carpenter released her single "Why" as a follow-up to last year's _Evolution_ and 2015's _Eyes Wide Open_.  To celebrate the release and generate more hype for "Why", Mirrored Media created a unique two-day pop up activation at Santa Monica Place with a custom built, LED photo booth.  From 10am until 10pm, fans and shoppers were encouraged to step inside the booth for an epic photo experience with friends and family while they danced along to "Why", which played on the surrounding speakers. Because of the unique design and allure of the color-changing LED strips, the booth not only attracted Carpenter's die-hard fans, but also many unsuspecting mall patrons who began the day unfamiliar with Carpenter and her music. Thousands of fans, new and old, enjoyed the activation over two days, with some coming back for second photos after day turned to night. Using the hashtag #SabrinaWhy, fans were able to share their photo booth experience while spreading the word about the release.
