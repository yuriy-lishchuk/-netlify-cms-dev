## Mirrored Media Wins Two Summit Emerging Media Awards

**Mirrored Media** is honored to announce that we have won two **2018 Summit Emerging Media Awards** for our **BMW i Road to Coachella** campaign in categories: Social Media "**Visionary**" and Events/Experiential "**Leader**".

The **Summit Emerging Media Award** (Summit EMA), began in 2007 and evolved through a need to recognize and celebrate creativity, innovation and those pushing the bounds of creative excellence in all forms of emerging media.

 “Those involved in today’s emerging media technologies are the leaders who are establishing tomorrow’s avenues of advertising communications and emphasizing the importance of the consumer’s experience.” Said Jocelyn Luciano, Executive Director for the Summit International Awards (SIA). “Most communication professionals recognize that established avenues of communication can be reliable and safe however audiences are becoming increasingly fragmented and difficult to engage, inform and affect.  Developing, applying and combining emerging media with creative messaging and market awareness is challenging.  Achieving this synthesis is what makes earning a Summit EMA a significant achievement.”

The Summit International Awards (SIA) organization is dedicated to furthering creative excellence in the communications industry. It administers three distinguished award competitions throughout the year with the goal of raising the awareness of companies and individuals who have the creative and marketing talent to go beyond the ordinary.

This SIA organization stands apart by offering a true competitive environment where entries are judged alongside those of their peers. Companies and individuals from more than 50 countries and across five continents participate in its award programs and choose to invest their promotional dollars for the opportunity and to be recognized as an SIA winner. The SIA organization conducts three awards each year: Summit Creative Award, Summit Emerging Media Award and Summit Marketing Effectiveness Award.
