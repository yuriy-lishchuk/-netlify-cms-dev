**About Road to Coachella:** 

This first-of-its-kind partnership paired renowned composer and producer Hans Zimmer with BMW i to create an artistic and visually-inspiring content piece featuring an original score by Zimmer himself along with a cast of Coachella and influencer cameos. The concept was unique in that it gave BMW the opportunity to create an open dialogue with its target audience while also fostering a narrative around why BMW partnered with Coachella. The campaign told the story of the partnership while blending multiple forms of art including music, film, photography, and automobiles across multiple genres. The success of the campaign allowed BMW to focus on a new lifestyle line of marketing that has now changed the direction of its 2018 efforts going forward.
