A big thank you is in order for such an amazing and successful night at TuneCore Live this past week. First, we want to everyone who came out and partied with us at ‪#‎TuneCoreLive‬ tonight - you rock!

Second, thank you to the amazing artists who performed - Curtis Peoples, Act As If and Best Of Friends - you were amazing. Act As If dazzled us with their amazing sound and lights, while Curtis Peoples got everyone up on their feet and singing out loud with his hilarious "Bye, Bye, Bye" cover.  Best OF FRIENDS ended the show with mesmerizing vocals and killer instrumentals. We loved it!

To our sponsors - TuneCore, Swisher Sweets, Swinghouse and Dropkloud, - you're amazing, and last but not least, Bardot-Hollywood.

The next show is already in the works, so be on the lookout for up-coming shows!
