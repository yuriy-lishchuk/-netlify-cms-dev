For the latest edition of CB2’s live music event series, dubbed After Hours, Stept and CB2 teamed up with Mirrored Media to create an exclusive in-store experience featuring Australian pop star Betty Who.

We were tasked with curating an intimate music venue within the confines of CB2’s SoHo location in the heart of New York City. The store shut its doors two hours early and by 9pm it had fully transformed into the Cb2 After Hours venue. Lucky guests were admitted via a first-come-first-serve basis until the store reached capacity. An After Hours neon sign in the exterior window told them they had come to the right place.

Upon entering, guests were guided down a long hallway with a custom neon sign and signature CB2 decor which led them to an expansive area of the store interior. They were invited to sip on drinks from the two open bars, courtesy of Home Beer and Union Wine, in this custom-lit space adorned with almost two dozen disco balls, staying in line with the After Hours theme. Brooklyn synth-pop duo Great Good Fine OK performed a special DJ set and got fans pumped up as they browsed the store, talked with friends, and awaited Betty Who’s exclusive performance. Custom signage, decals, and and art were placed throughout the store for multiple photo opportunities.

Fans were also invited to create their own shareable photos in front of a custom photo wall. This backdrop featured silver tinsel, a decorative Roman statue, and specialized colored lighting. Completing the visual was four unique kaleidoscope lens filters that guests were able to attach to their phones to capture the perfect photo.

Betty Who took the stage to a rousing ovation and delivered an energetic hour-long performance along with her two backup dancers. After her last song, Great Good Fine OK kept the energy high for the remainder of the evening.
