INTRODUCING THE 2018 EVENT MARKETER IT LIST

Recognizing the Top 100 Event Agencies of the Year

Each year Event Marketer's editors carefully review the credentials of hundreds of experiential agencies across the country to hand pick the 100 shops that represent the kind of best-in-class work and forward thinking that is pushing this industry forward. In this, our 16th year, and with a record-setting number of entries, we are proud to present the 2018 It List—the industry's only editorial listing of the Top 100 event agencies of the year.

A landscape touted for years as “uncluttered” has become anything but. As live experiences continue to draw more marketing dollars and generate higher marketing returns, there’s a good reason why more agencies than ever are getting into the experiential marketing business.

Adding agencies to this space forces hotter competition among them to win the hearts and budgets of clients. Never have the stakes been higher for today’s event agencies to craft integrated campaigns, blending strategy and creative, leading to flawless execution, with measurable results. Which is why we received more It List applications than ever this year.

From b-to-c to b-to-b and everything in between, the truly top agencies driving this industry forward have more in common than you’d think. Like the innate desire to understand the cultures they market to—the unique behaviors, beliefs and values that make a demographic tick. Or the increased focus on advocacy that today’s younger generations demand. At its core, experiential marketing is about forging meaningful connections, and that can only exist if both parties find common ground.

Putting all 100 agencies on the same table gives us an interesting vantage point. Note how many agencies are celebrating milestone birthdays—a testament to the longevity of so many of these companies. Take a look at the incredible industry-wide pivot to embrace the power of data (and data security). When it comes to influencer marketing, let’s just say proprietary platforms that connect the right tastemakers with the right audiences are the new black. And alas, notice how many agencies that graced the It List for years are no longer on it—a nod to the competitiveness of the current experiential landscape.

Of course, selecting the top agencies in an industry that continues to see explosive growth was no easy feat. The caliber of work and subsequent ROI that augments with each passing year never ceases to amaze. From cutting-edge interactives to unparalleled storytelling to out-of-box venues (think: laundromats and wine caves), the agencies on this list—and the tireless soldiers behind them—represent the absolute best in the biz.

Whether they’re newcomers or veterans, b-to-c or b-to-b, this year’s It List consistently delivers exceptional experiences backed by impactful creative and well-defined strategy. The kind of campaigns that give you goosebumps. The kind that make you want to share what you’re experiencing. And the kind that have the power to change the world around us.

To all of the agencies that made the grade, we salute you for continuously striving to make the impossible possible.
