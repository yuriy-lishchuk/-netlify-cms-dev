Five events. More than forty artists. One venue.

We couldn’t be happier with how our TuneCore Austin Takeover went. It all started Thursday, March 17th with the TuneCore Indie Artist Forum party.

Over the course of three days we were able to showcase amazing talent, throw raucous parties, and partner with TuneCore, Swisher Sweets, WorldArts, and Crave to pack the Vulcan Gas Company on 6th Street. Not to mention, we received over 16,000 RSVPs on Do512 for the five events!

Artists on our first day included: Flight of Ryan, Grayshot, Trevor Wesley, Towkio, Baby E, Lena Fayre, Lazyeyes, Nick Grant, and Blondfire.

_“TuneCore’s AustinTakeover was an incredible experience. It is a privilege and so much fun to spotlight the amazing up and coming talents on TuneCore like Jacob Latimore, Taylor Bennett, Miya Folick, and Trevor Wesley alongside legends like Wyclef Jean, Talib Kweli, and Waka Flaka Flame._ 

_And the varied styles over the week represent the breadth of what a TuneCore artist is – they can rock the house like Fantastic Negrito, Towkio, and Ron Pope or be intimate performers like Ciaran Lavery, Airlands, and The Wealthy West. “_

– Chris Mooney, Sr. Director of Artist Promotions & Strategic Relationships
