Participant Media has long been a major player at the annual Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. In the midst of acquiring the rights to the inspiring documentary, _RBG_, Participant also took the time to recognize one of its own inspiring figures. Over a hundred friends, colleagues, and team members gathered at Handle in Park City in honor of Diane Weyermann, Participant’s celebrated President of Documentary Film & Television. The private three-hour event featured farm-to-table hors d'oeuvres, an open bar with custom cocktails, a collection of wintry decor and floral arrangements, and a set by Tao’s house DJ Mel Debarge. Two TV screens displayed looped content of some of Participant Media’s feature films and documentaries.

 

Mirrored Media also provided a custom sound system, custom accent lighting, themed accent pieces, and specialty cocktail menus. Each drink was named after a Participant Media film, with corresponding menu designs reflecting the films’ lobby cards.

 

While the party was hosted in honor of Weyermann, she gave a short speech that honored her colleagues in attendance instead, praising their collaborative efforts for the rise and continued success of Participant Media.
