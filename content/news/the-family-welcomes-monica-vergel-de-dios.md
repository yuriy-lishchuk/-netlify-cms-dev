The Mirrored Media family gets a bit bigger this week with the addition of our Director of Brand Partnerships, Monica Vergel de Dios. 

Monica Vergel de Dios has an extensive background working in digital media, along with strategic partnerships and music event marketing. Monica most recently worked in partnerships and integrated marketing at SpinMedia where she managed integral accounts like Levi’s, Red Bull, Sonos, and more; ideating, pitching, and producing custom 360 programs. There, she also facilitated many outside vendor relationships, including Sofar Sounds the intimate in-home concert series, bringing them their first-ever brand partnership. Monica created and lead the “Bands and Brands” panel at the San Diego Music Things Conference in 2013. Monica previously worked at OMD as a Digital Media Strategist on Levi’s, Dockers, and a number of the Hilton accounts, including Embassy Suites where she strategized their first-ever SXSW music event integration.
