BizBash recently looked at 34 of the best activations at and around Coachella. BMW i's Road to Coachella not only made the cover, but was covered as two of the best activations around Coachella this year. Read the whole article [HERE](https://www.bizbash.com/coachella-2018-how-brands-stood-out-during-a-jam-packed-weekend/los-angeles/story/35562#.WuKaO9PwZUM).

Music lovers, millennials, and influencers—as well as the brands trying to reach them—flocked to the first weekend of Goldenvoice's Coachella Music and Arts Festival, held from April 13 through 16 at the [Empire Polo Club](https://www.bizbash.com/empire-polo-club/los-angeles/listing/811768). With more parties than any individual could possibly attend in a single weekend, brands used a variety of tactics to entice guests to attend their events.

Securing high-profile performers remained a popular go-to for many hosts, while an emphasis on wellness-centered offerings emerged as an increasingly popular trend this year. Other brands sought to upgrade festivalgoers' experience on the polo fields with exclusive lounges and customization opportunities.

Here are 34 of the cleverest activations, entertainment, and decor ideas that popped up everywhere from swanky Palm Springs estates to branded tents on the festival grounds.

The automotive company partnered with experiential marketing firm [Mirrored Media](https://www.bizbash.com/mirrored-media/los-angeles/listing/923587) for a campaign that saw 15 BMW i8 and i3's wrapped in a colorful custom design created by Portugal the Man's John Gourley. Social-media influencers then drove the iFleets to the festival, sharing their road trip with followers along the way.
