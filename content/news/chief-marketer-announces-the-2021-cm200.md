Norwalk, CT, December 16, 2020 – Chief Marketer, a leading publisher of content, recognition programs and training events for Fortune 1000 marketers, today unveiled the 2021 Chief Marketer 200. It is the world’s only editorial listing of best-in-class brand engagement and activation agencies.

“In a year when brand engagement and activation took on entirely new meaning, the agencies recognized in this year’s CM200 quickly took action to help their clients innovate and move forward,” says Jessica Heasley, Group Editor & Publisher at Chief Marketer. “The CM200 represents a comprehensive portfolio of strategic partners who can help brands evolve and thrive in 2021 and beyond.”

Chief Marketer’s editors accepted applications from across the country for the CM200 earlier this fall. Winners were selected based on several criteria including: insightful client testimonials; outstanding case study submissions; high caliber, consistent work across programs and clients; innovative and creative executions; and bold and inspiring concepts and ideas that are moving the industry forward. The 200 agencies selected for this year’s program are thought leaders in their craft and representative of the best of the marketing industry.
