TuneCore and Swisher Sweets officially premiere their first Convenience Store Session video today – amazing talent in a unique spot. The Convenience Store Sessions will feature a 10-episode video series that capture surprise pop-up performances from some of our favorite artists and bands. The first video features Santa Barbara's FMLYBND – their electrifying energy and sound makes it feel like you are right there jammin' alongside them!

Wondering how it works? The production and sound crew film as a band comes in, sets up and plays live while the store is open. The footage catches all the unrehearsed interactions between the band, employees and actual customers as they see something amazing develop right before their eyes in a short, unique setting – a convenience store.  The sessions are unannounced, so you'll just have to stumble upon one to see it live.

Credit for the Convenience Store Sessions is owed to [Swisher Sweets](http://www.swisher.com/portfolio/swisher-sweets/swisher-sweets/) and their [Swisher Sweets Artist Project](http://ap.swishersweets.com/), in association with [TuneCore](http://www.tunecore.com/). The #SwisherArtistProject is an ongoing initiative that provides unique opportunities for both artists and fans – artists are able to create, share, and pursue their passion, and fans are able to be at the forefront of what's new and emerging in the world of music, arts and entertainment.

"Swisher has always had tremendous support from the artist community and musicians specifically," added Ghiloni, "The Artist Project is our way to support the emerging artist as they pursue their passions."

TuneCore, a digital music distribution company, shares Swisher's passion for helping artists who are trying to make a living at their art. "TuneCore has always championed the artist, looking for creative ways to support its extensive community of talented indie artists," says Scott Ackerman, TuneCore CEO. "The Convenience Store Sessions extend what TuneCore does through its online services and digital tools by creating on-the-ground experiences that provide high-profile exposure opportunities for TuneCore Artists."

TuneCore's involvement with the Swisher Artist Project is a part of their ever-expanding Artist Relations Initiative, which focuses on helping musicians succeed and build their careers.
