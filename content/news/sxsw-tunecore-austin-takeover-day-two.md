If you thought Day 1 of our TuneCore Austin Takeover looked fun, Friday, March 18th made way for an even busier day! Two events taking place over fourteen hours brought hundreds more people walking through the doors to see our talented artists.

### Day Party

Dead Stars kicked off Day 2 with their nostalgic 90s revival rock. The trio from Brooklyn was followed by an eclectic series of sets from the bluesy Truett, the rocking Ron Pope and his Nighthawks, and the folky Ciaran Lavery.

Two duos to share the stage were Pr0files and Deap Vally. Decked out in American flag jump suits and rock ‘n roll attitudes, Deap Vally brought the heat!  Totally glammed out and complete with bass drum leaps, fans came ready to rock out.

On the other end of the musical spectrum, the wonderfully synthy Pr0files used dual facing laptops. Their unique set up was center stage, a full electronics workspace!

Riding high off their latest release _Stranger Things_, headliners Yuck played old favorites and new cuts to an eager crowd of fans. They provided an indie rock warm up for everyone’s night as they closed out the event.

And with that, we had just a couple hours to clean up and get ready for the night party!

### Night Party

The sun went down and the doors of the Vulcan Gas Company opened to a capacity line. World Arts Winners MRKTS and The Record Company took full advantage of their time on stage and were ready to entertain a packed house. Nothing like a little harmonica and lap steel to get it started, right?

The crowd moved and mingled to the sweet sounds of Brandon Kinder’s The Wealthy West, rocked out to the post-punk vibes of Holy Esque, cooled out to Kevin Calabra’s Airlands project, and threw their hands up for MC Kap G.

It was when Boston’s Sammy Adams hit the stage that it really started to pop off. Energetic, genuine, and highly anticipated, the MC proved to be a true performer in every sense of the word.

Finally, late into the evening, our headliner and household name Wyclef Jean stepped up the mic! The man did not disappoint.

Performing a set of well known hits and new cuts, Wyclef made the stage his home, introducing Trae Tha Truth and Carnivale dancers up to entertain a wildly grateful audience. Not to mention the amazing singalong for “Gone Til November”!
