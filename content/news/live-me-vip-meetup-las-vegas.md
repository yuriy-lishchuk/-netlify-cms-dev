In January 2018, Live.me teamed up with Mirrored Media to treat a group of its VIPs to a weekend getaway in Las Vegas. As a thank you to some of the biggest spenders on the live broadcasting platform, Live.me provided travel vouchers, accommodations, and specially-arranged activities during this unforgettable weekend.

It all began at the iconic Bellagio Hotel in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. These VIP broadcasters were then whisked away to SPEEDVEGAS, Las Vegas’ premiere exotic car racecourse. At the facility, we set up a private viewing location above the track complete with balloons, gourmet catering, and even a custom Live.me cake. Guests were given detailed instructions by the highly-trained professionals at the facility to ensure a safe experience. Then they were all able to head down to the track and pick out one of several sports cars with Live.me branding on the hoods. Choices ranged from a Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, and Mercedes. Once suited up in their car of choice, these lucky VIPs got behind the wheel and sped around the professional-grade course, reaching speeds of 150 mph.

Following the exciting afternoon at SPEEDVEGAS, the luxury shuttles brought guests back to the Bellagio to regroup before their big night out. Our team arranged a full VIP experience at Encore’s XS Nightclub. The VIPs were escorted in to the owner’s tables, complete with bottle service, custom signs displayed by VIP hostesses, and digital Live.me branding on the large stage. Diplo performed one of his legendary DJ sets that night as they party raged on until the wee hours of the morning.
