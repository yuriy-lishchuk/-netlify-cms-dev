In order to highlight BMW’s partnership and employee discount program with Southern California Edison, Mirrored Media teamed up with the automotive giant to present an exclusive activation for SCE team members at their Rosemead, CA location. The BMW Premier Partner Experience gave guests an opportunity to learn more about, and even test drive, the i Series, BMW’s line of hybrid/electric vehicles. With SCE’s continued efforts to develop renewable forms of energy and BMW i’s penchant for innovation and sustainability, these two were the perfect fit.

From 10am - 5pm, registered employees were able to stop by the activation, located on a large portion of the campus’ parking lot, and become fully immersed in the BMW i brand. Upon entering, guests were given BMW-branded reusable water bottles provided by S’well. They were greeted with the two primary models of the BMW i Series, the i8 and i3, on custom on-brand display platforms. Employees were invited to take a seat inside each car, while BMW brand ambassadors were on hand to offer more information and assistance. Guests were also invited to step into the photo booth, which featured a co-branded SCE/BMW step and repeat.

A large branded BMW semi truck provided a backdrop for the VIP lounge. Located adjacent to the truck, and covered by a large BMW canopy, this carpeted area featured several perks for employees to enjoy, including:

- Donuts provided by Voodoo Donuts
- Gourmet coffee bar
- Hint water
- Two TVs featuring looped branded content
- White lounge furniture
- Floral decor and planters
- Sound system with music

The highlights of the activation were the three driving experiences. Guests had the opportunity to get behind the wheel of one of nine BMWs, including the i3, M2, M4 Convertible, X4, X5, 530e, or 7 Series, for an exclusive test drive in one of three scenarios:

- Accel/Decel: Drivers accelerate rapidly then hit the brakes on a closed course
- Slalom: Drivers hug tight corners between cones on a closed course
- Neighborhood Drive: Drivers take the car for a spin around the neighborhood streets adjacent to the SCE campus

All cars were affixed with BMW Premier Partner Experience decals and BMW subsidiary MINI even provided several models for guests to drive in the neighborhood scenario.

MINI also had its own footprint within the space, providing a relaxing camping vibe with turf, lawn chairs, and a custom trailer. Additional perks included: 

- Pressed juice courtesy of Juice Served Here
- Branded mugs
- Corn hole
- Giant Connect 4
