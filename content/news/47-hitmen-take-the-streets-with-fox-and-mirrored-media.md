To promote the upcoming video game adaptation, Twentieth Century Fox took to the streets of San Diego with 47 different cosplayers dressed as the title character from **[Hitman: Agent 47](http://www.comingsoon.net/movie/hitman-agent-47-2015)**! The squad of Hitmen marched through the Gaslamp district posing with fans and handing out posters for the film, then even took to Petco Park during MTV’s Fandom Awards, where stars Rupert Friend and Hannah Weir presented an award on stage with their 47-member entourage. You can check out the photos of the group in the gallery below and check out the official prelude comic for the series [by clicking here](https://www.comixology.com/Hitman-Agent-47-Official-Movie-Prelude/digital-comic/254585).

Directed by first time helmer Aleksander Bach, the film stars Rupert Friend (“Homeland,” **The Young Victoria**), Zachary Quinto (**Star Trek**, **Margin Call**), Hannah Ware (“Betrayal,” “Boss”), Thomas Kretschmann (“Dracula,” **Avengers: Age of Ultron**), Dan Bakkedahl (**The Heat**, **Observe and Report**) and Ciaran Hinds (**Frozen**, **The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby**).

**Hitman: Agent 47** centers on an elite assassin who was genetically engineered from conception to be the perfect killing machine, and is known only by the last two digits on the barcode tattooed on the back of his neck. He is the culmination of decades of research – and forty-six earlier Agent clones — endowing him with unprecedented strength, speed, stamina and intelligence. His latest target is a mega-corporation that plans to unlock the secret of Agent 47’s past to create an army of killers whose powers surpass even his own. Teaming up with a young woman who may hold the secret to overcoming their powerful and clandestine enemies, 47 confronts stunning revelations about his own origins and squares off in an epic battle with his deadliest foe.

**Hitman: Agent 47** hits theaters on August 21.
