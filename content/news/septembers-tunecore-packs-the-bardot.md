We are still filled to the brim with admiration and love for all the artists who came out to play at September's TuneCore Live in Los Angeles last Saturday. It's been decided that Split Screens, Joel Taylor, and Desi Valentine are the only artists we're playing in the office this month. These musicians packed a house and made people sway through the early hours of the night.

We'll see you at next month's TuneCore Live, with Swisher Sweets and TuneCore!
