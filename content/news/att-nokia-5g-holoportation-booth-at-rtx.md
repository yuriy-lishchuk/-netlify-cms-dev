To showcase the future capabilities of the much-anticipated 5G Network, AT&T and Nokia partnered with Fullscreen and Mirrored Media to build a cutting edge mixed reality experience at the annual RTX convention in Austin, TX.  Attendees were able to experience groundbreaking real-time interactive holograms with their friends and surprise Rooster Teeth talent. Two guests at a time could step into the booth and magically be transformed into holograms and engage alongside their favorite Rooster Teeth talent. Each of the holograms could engage with each other live as onlookers were able to watch the action via two TVs positioned at the front of the booth. These holograms showcased the future of communication through lighting-fast, high-res connectivity made possible with the power of AT&T’s 5G network.
