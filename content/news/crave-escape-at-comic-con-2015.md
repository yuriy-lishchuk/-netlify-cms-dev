This [Comic-Con](http://craveonline.com/hub/comic-con), Crave is returning to the historic USS Midway in an attempt to best [last year’s amazing night](http://www.craveonline.com/comics/articles/733667-craveonline-and-tnts-the-last-ship-came-saw-and-conquered-comic-con-2014#/slide/1) of musical revelry. In partnership with [Alienware](http://www.alienware.com/) and Mirrored Media, we’re proud to present yet another massive crowd-pleaser, featuring an amazing line-up consisting of none other than **Cold War Kids**,**Bad Suns**, and **Cathedrals**!

What better way to catch a break from the noise and congestion of Comic-Con than to take part in an exclusive concert on a monumental aircraft carrier? Adjacent to the Convention Center and Comic-Con epicenter, the USS Midway is just a short walk away from the costumed mayhem, where three premier musical acts will undoubtedly set the perfect tone for what is sure to be the most memorable event at this year’s Comic-Con.

Nathan Willett, Dann Gallucci and Maust of [Cold War Kids](http://www.coldwarkids.com/site/home) will headline the event, performing songs from their epic, arena-ready album _Hold My Home_. Supporting the Los Angeles-based band will be alt-rock favorites (and Angelenos) [Bad Suns](http://badsuns.tumblr.com/), who just recently released their debut album, _Language & Perspective_, as well as electro-pop duo [Cathedrals](http://wearecathedrals.com/). Add to this an outrageous Cosplay Contest hosted by Alienware, and obviously, it’s going to be one hell of a night!

Space is extremely limited at this special event and you must be 21+ with photo ID to enter. Visit Craveescape.com to RSVP while there's still time.  Also be sure to follow Crave Online via social media to win VIP tickets!
