Sour Patch Kids candy teamed up with Fullscreen to launch its new "Breaking Out" video series which is being billed as the first branded show to cast a group of YouTube stars as scripted characters. The series features four influential YouTube stars: [O2L’s Ricky Dillon](http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/these-youtubers-are-generation-s-rock-stars-159406), Andrea Russett, Chris Collins and Brent Rivera. Collectively the stars claim 5 million YouTube subscribers. The series follows the four characters through the ups and downs of being a teenager while also plugging Sour Patch Kids characters. In the first three-minute video, Russett (who counts more than 1.7 million [YouTube subscribers](https://www.youtube.com/user/andrearussett)) plays Andrea Smith, the new girl at school. When things go awry with her locker in one scene, a set of animated Sour Patch Kids jump out of her backpack.

To launch the series, Fullscreen and Sour Patch Kids partnered with Mirrored Media to produce a launch event at the Santa Monica Place, in Santa Monica CA.  On Sunday, Oct. 5, social media superstars Andrea Russett, Chris Collins, Brent Rivera and Ricky Dillon appeared at Santa Monica Place Plaza to premiere exclusive footage from their new online show “Breaking Out”! The first 200 fans had the chance to meet their favorite stars, watch exclusive footage, and enjoy a Q&A about their upcoming series. Lucky fans also had the opportunity to get some exclusive SPK merchandise, candy, and jump into the photo booth with their favorite star.
