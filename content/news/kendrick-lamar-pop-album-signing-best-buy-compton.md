At 9:30am on April 20th, Kendrick Lamar announced that he would be holding a surprise album signing for 3,000 fans at Best Buy in Compton, CA at 4pm.  This would be the third time he has celebrated an album release with his fans at this location- the first two times being for the release of _Good Kid, M.A.A.D City_ & _To Pimp A Butterfly._ Kendrick arrived 40 mins early and met with fans all the way until 10:30pm, with only one quick break to eat – his dedication and tenacity during the event were unlike anything anyone there had ever seen at a signing.

Several local news stations, press outlets, and radio stations were on site to capture the moment- George Pennacchio from ABC7 got an exclusive interview with The King himself, where he expressed the importance in doing this for his fans, saying, "If I see my favorite artist or someone that I admire, it would give me so much motivation being a 9-year-old or 10-year-old or 20-year-old kid. I just know what type of fire it would put inside their heart, to continue doing whatever they're doing. Whether it's furthering their education or playing sports."  Kendrick attracted an array of fans, from timid toddlers to passionate fans who have been listening to and finding inspiration in his music since day one.  A mom stood in the multiple-hour line in the heat so that she could have her son, an overseas U.S. soldier, FaceTime with his biggest inspiration.  Many fans left crying and in complete shock, just wanting to absorb that quick moment they got to share with their King.  Lamar also took a moment to say 'hey' to all of his fans who were tuning in on his Instagram Live feed, where he briefly mentioned that more new music is coming.

Kung Fu Kenny remained all smiles as he met with over 2,500 loyal fans, signing 2,930 CDs during the seven-hour event.

Needless to say, Kendrick does have _hustle though, ambition, flow, inside his DNA._

DAMN.
