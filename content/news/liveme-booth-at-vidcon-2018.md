To celebrate LiveMe's broadcasting community and unique app features, the company once again teamed up with Mirrored Media and opted for an elaborate and eye-catching build designed to entertain the fans that consistently occupied the footprint each day.

Located just inside VidCon's main entrance, the two-story consumer experience featured a second story DJ booth and adjacent stage for performances and appearances, a branded rotating halo sign, a large die-cut logo, and TV screens showing both live streamed content and top LiveMe broadcasts.

The highlight of the booth was the money machine, which doubled as a shareable photo opp. Guests were challenged to grab as much LiveMe money as they could in the machine that was then redeemable for custom LiveMe swag and giveaways. Some were even lucky enough to walk away with real money, as the DJ occasionally fired off a cash cannon corresponding with in-app live stream gifts.
