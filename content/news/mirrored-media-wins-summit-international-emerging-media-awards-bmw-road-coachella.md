This first-of-its-kind partnership paired renowned composer and producer Hans Zimmer with BMW i to create an artistic and visually-inspiring content piece featuring an original score by Zimmer himself along with a cast of Coachella and influencer cameos. The concept was unique in that it gave BMW the opportunity to create an open dialogue with its target audience while also fostering a narrative around why BMW partnered with Coachella.

The success of the campaign allowed BMW to focus on a new lifestyle line of marketing that has now changed the direction of its 2018 efforts going forward.
