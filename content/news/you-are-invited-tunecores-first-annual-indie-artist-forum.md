Honored to be involved with TuneCore as they prepare for their first annual Indie Artist Forum on September 19-20! We will be at SIR Studios this weekend with TuneCore and all sponsors, fostering a community of positivity and support amongst all the indie artists who are creating music independently and feeling empowered by those around them. This forum is important to us because at the core of Mirrored Media is a love for music and the drive to forge relationships with emerging artists so that we can find them unique spaces to be heard.

We hope to see you there!
