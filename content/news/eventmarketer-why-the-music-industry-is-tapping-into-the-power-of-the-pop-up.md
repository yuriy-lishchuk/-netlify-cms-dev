The allure of the pop-up has permeated a new industry: the music biz. Artists from [Slipknot](https://loudwire.com/slipknot-hollywood-pop-up-shop-knotfest-roadshow/) to [Madonna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4sqXkAT0BI) are leveraging pop-ups to hype new tours, engage fans and push merchandise in an era when album sales are no longer a musician’s bread and butter. Some feature brand partners, many include interactive experiences and virtually every genre of music has been covered (look no further than this [pop-up dedicated to Johann Sebastian Bach](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/arts/music/pop-up-bach-store.html)). For some experiential inspiration, take a look at the following steal-worthy pop-up strategies inspired by the modern music industry.

### **Khalid**

With his sights set on balancing “Instagrammable moments and a tangible item” Khalid promoted his sophomore album “Free Spirit” with a pop-up shop created in partnership with BMW during this year’s Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The contemporary soul artist (and BMW driver) helped the automaker outfit an assortment of its vehicles to match the aesthetic of his album cover, which features flames and a wolf, ahead of the event.

During the festival, [the “Pit Stop” pop-up](https://www.eventmarketer.com/article/inside-the-biggest-experiential-marketing-programs-at-coachella-2019/) offered limited-edition merchandise, a look at the fleet of “Free Spirit”-inspired BMWs and Khalid’s own restored ’70s-era van, which was also designed to match the album cover. In addition to shoppable merch, the pop-up experience featured a claw machine that gave fans a chance to snag exclusive Khalid bandanas (which could be custom embroidered on-site), food trucks, games, music and, on one afternoon—a visit from Khalid himself.
