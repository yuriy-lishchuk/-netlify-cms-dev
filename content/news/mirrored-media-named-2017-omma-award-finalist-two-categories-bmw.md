We are proud to announce that Mirrored Media has been named a 2017 [MediaPost OMMA Award](https://www.mediapost.com/ommaawards/finalists/) Finalist in two categories. The OMMA Awards is an annual awards event that honors the best campaigns in Online Marketing Media and Advertising (OMMA) by agencies and advertisers that push the potential of digital advertising. Both categories awarded our BMW Road to Coachella campaign. 

## OMMA Awards - ONLINE ADVERTISING CREATIVITY

### BMW's Road to Coachella

Precision and risk, artistry and adventure marked the Road to Coachella for BMW and acclaimed composer/ producer Hans Zimmer. From this unique partnership, an original branded content piece was created that synthesized music, art, design, and technology. Showcasing the brand's i series designs through compelling visuals interspersed with rehearsal and sound stage footage featuring Zimmer's original score and the work of Coachella artists, it earned over 33 million impressions. An influencer campaign generated 20.5 million impressions, and festival fans documented their own journey to Coachella.

## OMMA Awards - ONLINE MARKETING

### BMW's Road to Coachella

The campaign promoting BMW’s partnership with Coachella fused together digital and social elements by creating original branded content. It introduced Coachella fans to BMW while garnering millions of views and tens-of-millions of impressions organically, going viral across social media almost instantly. The campaign told the story of the partnership while blending multiple forms of art including music, film, photography, and automobiles. Festival-goers could win passes to Coachella by documenting their own preparation and journey to the Valley via social media using #RoadToCoachella.

The winners of the 2017 OMMA Awards will be announced in September at an awards ceremony in New York City.
