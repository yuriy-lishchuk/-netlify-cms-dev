Mirrored Media teamed up with BMG Production Music to host a celebration in honor of the full service sound agency, it's artists, and the men and women who encompass the BMG team.

The event took place on April 27th at Bardot in Hollywood with nearly 150 guests showing up to support their fellow colleagues, friends and family members who are the critical components of a new age music company making big waves in the world of music supervision, composition, and advertising.

After a warm welcome and brief introduction to some of the core members of the BMG Production Music team, three of BMG's signed artists took to the stage to perform a few of their original tracks.  DJ William Lifestyle kept the party going in the interim while guests enjoyed tray passed hors d'auevres including miniature shots of tomato bisque with grilled cheese triangles, chicken satay, an array of sliders and an open bar.  A BMG branded step and repeat located at the red-carpeted entrance gave those who arrived and departed an opportunity to connect with their peers while enjoying a memorable photo opportunity.  Bardot is well known for its signature indoor/outdoor patio and connecting lounge, so Mirrored Media set out to ensure that the entirety of the space was adorned to accentuate the essence of the room, yet fully branded to embody the BMG brand.

The night was a successful celebration that seemed to generate a newfound excitement and appreciation for the future of BMG Production Music and it's team.
