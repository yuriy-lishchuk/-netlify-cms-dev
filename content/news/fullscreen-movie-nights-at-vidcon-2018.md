Fullscreen’s 5th Annual Movie Night series at this year’s VidCon in Anaheim, CA, was a stellar opportunity for the company to tap longtime partner, Mirrored Media, to present three of the hottest films of 2018 and give fans a night to remember!  At the screenings of _Love, Simon_, _Teen Titans Go! To The Movies_, and _Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,_ guests enjoyed various activations and giveaways including:  

_Love, Simon_ : This screening featured t-shirt giveaways to the first 300 guests, followed by raffles to win blankets, shirts, cups, phone cases, and other film swag.

_Teen Titans Go! To The Movies_: Guests stepped into a Warner Bros photo booth with paparazzi cutouts to mimic a red carpet opening. Those in line received branded backpacks and pins, while costumed characters from the film roamed the crowd posing for photos.  Guests enjoyed popcorn and drinks from branded cups. 

_Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again_: Guests were able to get flash tattoos and beach balls prior to the movie screening while guests got to step in front of an interactive step and repeat photo booth moment for the yet to be released film. A line of guests took photos with props inspired by the movie.
