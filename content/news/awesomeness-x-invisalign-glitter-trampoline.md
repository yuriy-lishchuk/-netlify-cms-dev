The Awesomeness x Invisalign Glitter Trampoline was situated just outside the convention center’s main entrance. Sitting adjacent to the Grand Plaza’s fountain, this photo booth invited guests to enter a trampoline enclosure and jump around while thousands of sequins sparkled and danced around them. The action was captured by a custom array of cameras, providing a 180˚ 3D photo animation that guests could instantly share via kiosks at the activation’s exit. Each photo contained a co-branded Awesomeness and Invisalign overlay. From the outside, the trampoline enclosure had no shortage of branding, with custom wrapped stairs and branded exterior walls that raised high above the fountains, prominently visible throughout the Grand Plaza.

About 4,400 unique photos were captured over the four-day activation.
