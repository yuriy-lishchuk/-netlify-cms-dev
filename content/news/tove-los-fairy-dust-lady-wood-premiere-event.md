## Tove Lo's Fairy Dust and Lady Wood Premiere Event

This past weekend, Mirrored Media produced an invite-only music video screening and release event for Swedish singer and songwriter Tove Lo at a historic theater in Hollywood. Deemed “Sweden’s darkest pop export” by _Rolling Stone_, the 29-year-old is best known for her raw, grunge-influenced take on pop music and chart-topping hits like "Habits (Stay High)", "Talking Body", and her new single, "Cool Girl". She has also written countless other hits for artists such as Ellie Goulding and Icona Pop. 

Tove Lo hosted the event to screen and celebrate the release of her new short film “Fairy Dust”, directed by Tim Erem, as well as her second album _Lady Wood_. Explaining her short film, she said in a statement: “My short film is about the never-ending escape and all the rushes and pain that comes with it. I always dreamt about doing something like this, and that I get to share this with all of you now feels unreal. THANK YOU my dear friend and director Timothy Erem, and our whole team and crew for making this movie possible. Love you forever. Now…open up and take it in. #FAIRYDUST”. The film stars Tove Lo alongside American actress Lina Esco (Kingdom, Flaked) and features five songs from the Lady Wood album including, “True Disaster,” “Influence,” “Lady Wood,” “Cool Girl,” and “Vibes."

The event featured a red carpet step-and-repeat, a screening of the short film, and a carnival rave after-party hosted by Tove Lo. In line with the raunchy multi-layered exploration of sexuality in the film, the party under the stars was an adult-themed carnival dropped into the middle of Hollywood. It included a large stage with a DJ performance by Cut Snake, carnival rides, custom adult-themed carnival games, a photo booth with a contortionist, adult-themed henna tattoos, black light arm tattoos, carnival food, and so much more. Thanks to Beats, fans were also able to listen to _Lady Wood_ on headphones while riding on the ferris wheel. 

Just before midnight, Tove Lo and her producer, Tim Erem, took the stage where Tove sang an impromptu version of “Cool Girl” before leading a countdown to her and Tim's birthday. When the clock hit 12, the pair was surprised with a cake as Tove sprayed the crowd with a cryo cannon. 

The event displayed custom signage and displays produced by Mirrored Media, including a gold 17-foot _Lady Wood_ logo build-out that guests walked through as they entered the event. 

The event was produced by Mirrored Media in conjunction with Rembrandt Flores, EFG PR, Tove Lo, Tim Erem, Island Records, Universal Music Group, and Diktator.
