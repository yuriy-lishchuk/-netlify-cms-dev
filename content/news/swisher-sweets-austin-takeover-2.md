Mirrored Media teamed up with cigar giant Swisher Sweets to take over Austin and give festivalgoers the opportunity to sample, experience, and party with Swisher Sweets.  They joined Brooklyn Vegan, TuneCore, DropKloud, and CraveOnline to host 6 days of events at Red 7 and The Vulcan Gas Company.

Swisher Sweets established the artist project to bring passionate emerging artists and musicians to its consumers.  It's the hope that the artist project will bring new artists to light and help to springboard them to reach the next level of their careers.  In the end, it all comes back to introducing fans to great music.
