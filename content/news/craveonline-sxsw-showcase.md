The wild musical marathon of SxSW 2015 saved the best for last, as CraveOnline’s showcase on Saturday proved to be a blowout of cinematically exhilarating proportions. The event drew over 3,200 guests in the doors. With a line stacked up the rain-soaked street long before doors even opened, the crowds would soon flood 5th avenue as they struggled for space to catch the wild dynamics of Action Bronson, Doomtree, Smallpools, Irontom and The Black Cadillacs at the Vulcan Gas Company. Unexpected thrills happened like Action Bronson, at the end of his set, simply walked off the stage and out the front door creating a mob experience for fans and festival goers who didn't make it into the event to see his set. The event was featured as one of the top unofficial day parties on Do512.
