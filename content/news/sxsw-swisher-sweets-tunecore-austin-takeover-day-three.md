During the final day of TuneCore’s 2016 Austin Takeover, we handed the reigns over to our friends at Swisher Sweets. While Swisher’s promotional squad, the Sweeties were at every event this week giving out free samples to very grateful patrons, Saturday, March 19th was truly a Swisher Sweet Takeover at the Vulcan Gas Company.

And boy did they pack a punch with the lineups!

### Day Party

A red carpet, tons of photo opps, and all the Swisher Sweets swag you could get, SXSW-attendees may have been getting tired, but not enough to skip our festivities.

One of the most impressive sets of the day came early from TuneCore Artist Fantastic Negrito, who you may remember from last year when he and his band rocked out in the soda aisle for Swisher Sweets [soda aisle for Swisher Sweets’ Convenience Store Sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPG_xV6ND8Y).

Chicago’s Taylor Bennett (brother of Chance The Rapper) treated an enthusiastic crowd to cuts off of 2015’s excellent _Broad Shoulders_, and while many in the audience came for hip hop, Miya Folick attracted a whole new crowd of fans with her Cat Power-like brand of indie folk

TuneCore familiar face and Cincinnati’s own Buggs Tha Rocka sported hot shades and made the stage his with high-energy rhymes over spacey stoned beats.

Fans waited all afternoon for the legendary MC Talib Kweli to hit the stage, and he, too, did not disappoint. Playing a captivating and energetic set, Vulcan attendees were treated a combination of new songs and old favorites, dating back to his debut release.

Always the hip hip mentor, Talib brought out some of his protege acts – Space Invadaz, K’Valentine, and NIKO IS – out on stage to join him. It was like a party within a party.

Andy Allo, who [similarly rocked out for Swisher Sweets’ Convenience Store Sessions](http://www.tunecore.com/blog/2015/07/andy-allo-plays-live-in-a-convenience-store.html) last year, kicked out the jams, alternating between acoustic and electric guitars and carrying the set with her incredible voice and performance abilities. Her mix of pop, soul and rock made the for a perfect end to the day’s festivities. Now it was time to get ready for a whole new show.

### Night Party

When you put Waka Flocka Flame as the headliner of your last show during SXSW, people are going to show up early. That was the case as we opened the doors of the Vulcan Gas Company and let eager fans flood in from 6th Street.

Knowing it was most folks’ last night in town, each and every artist on the bill brought their all. Goldyard, Tre Capital and Bingx all brought their sets to the people by jumping into the crowd to soak up the love. Bingx, in fact, decided to show off his acrobatic skills as seen above.

Local favorites/husband and wife duo Riders Against the Storm showed us all how Austin does it, and teen heartthrob Jacob Latimore brought a female fan on stage to serenade her. K’Valentine and NIKO IS shared a DJ (eventually leading to a Talib Kweli second round appearance), and Yonas performed cuts from his last EP _Going Places_ and his new mixtape _The English Architect_.

Perhaps one of the most captivating sets of the night came from TuneCore Artist and Nashville-newcomer R.LUM.R. Drawing comparisons to the Weeknd, the soulful indie performer treated the crowd to his first full-band set, and even joined in on the fun by taking selfies mid-set with fans. An encore was eventually demanded.

Headliner Waka Flocka Flame gave the set of his life – nearly 2 hours – and turned the Vulcan into a shaking house party. Playing old favorites and new cuts, Waka didn’t hold back on intensity and energy. We couldn’t think of a better way to end a 14-hour Swisher Sweets Takeover!
