We’re psyched to announce that Act As If, Curtis Peoples, and Best Of Friends will be performing live at the next TuneCore Live show, on May 26. We look forward to another packed house!

If you haven’t made it to one of our shows yet, what are you waiting for?! Come down, let us know what you’re up to, ask us questions, and share some fun – our west coast TuneCore team will be in attendance and are ready to kick it. And make sure to bring your dancing shoes, because we have some amazing TuneCore Artists sharing the stage this month.
