In 2011, Justin Lefkovitch founded _[Mirrored Media](http://www.mirroredmedia.com/)_, a leading experiential marketing company that specializes in creating high impact, enduring lifestyle campaigns that unite marquee artists with influential brands. The 28-year-old and his tight-knit team of skilled young forward-thinkers help brands connect with their target demographic through crafting organic music experiences.

The ever-evolving convergence of marketing, entertainment, technology and culture has reached an exciting turning point. With the advertising industry transitioning into the new entertainment business, more brands are expanding into the lifestyle space in unconventional ways. Brands are discovering the deeper value in partnering with various artists and influencers to craft content and campaigns that solidify their position within pop culture. Understanding the seamless merger of music and digital media, brands and marketers are collaborating to create products, platforms, and experiences that authentically engage a millennial audience.

While advertisers continue investing the bulk of their attention and resources into developing mobile-focused digital videos and cutting edge social programs, there’s an evident gold mine emerging in the realm of live events and experiential marketing. In an era where festivals stand as the thriving pulse of music, touring is more frequent than ever, and brands seek to participate at each stage of the consumer journey, experiential marketing offers the perfect opportunity to experiment with truly cutting edge concepts. With a foresight of the changing landscape, Justin Lefkovitch set out to build a company that would provide the blueprint for how brands and artists collaborate to not only achieve their goals, but also enhance and advance their art form in the process.

While a student at [Pepperdine University](http://www.forbes.com/colleges/pepperdine-university/), Justin began managing renowned singer/songwriter Ray Kennedy, stepping in to handle various aspects of his career. Serving as his first introduction to the music business, Lefkovitch learned the dynamics of the industry, while further discovering the deficiencies and frustrations that artists endured. One particular issue that stood out was the evident disconnect between brands and artists, with neither side able to identify the shared values required to forge healthy, authentic partnerships. “I looked at what was happening in other aspects of entertainment, in sports and in movies, where brands had really figured out how to market in that space and evolve the art form through product placements that were organic and authentic,” Lefkovitch told Forbes. [“At that time, brands, music and entertainment working together seemed like selling out, but I knew there was a way to make it work authentically.”](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1U8T8v3&text=%22At%20that%20time%2C%20brands%20and%20music%20working%20together%20seemed%20like%20selling%20out%2C%20but%20I%20knew%20there%20was%20a%20way%20to%20make%20it%20work.%22)

 Taking his learned knowledge and innate instincts; Justin developed a business plan and submitted to a contest held by the University. Making it to the finals, Lefkovitch gained the spark and confirmation needed to fully believe in his idea. His passion and vision attracted the attention of Grammy Award Winning composer Steven Kofsky, who became Justin’s first investor and business partner. From there, through diligence and tireless work, Mirrored Media was born and quickly rose to prominence. “He had a lot of passion for what he was doing, and to me, he had a very good idea,” Kofsky told Forbes. [“He believed in his idea, and the concept of how he wanted to execute the idea, but his passion was the key — he was ahead of his years.”](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1U8T8v3&text=%22He%20believed%20in%20his%20idea%20and%20how%20he%20wanted%20to%20execute%20the%20idea%2C%20but%20his%20passion%20was%20key%20--%20he%20was%20ahead%20of%20his%20years.%22)

Today, his growing roster of global clients includes [Google](http://www.forbes.com/companies/google) [GOOGL +2.19%](http://www.forbes.com/companies/google), Acura, TuneCore, Mophie, Fullscreen, Awesomeness TV, and Crave Online. From prominent festivals and premiere conferences, to nationwide tours and disruptive pop up activations – Mirrored Media is widely credited with delivering massively successful live events that drive awareness, engagement, influence and capital for each brand partner. Receiving recognition for their groundbreaking work and innovative approach to developing interactive branded entertainment experiences, Mirrored Media earned a coveted spot on Event Marketer’s 2015 It List of Top 100 Event Agencies.

With a growing group of smart and savvy employees representing richly diverse perspectives and a broad scope of industry experience extending across music, media and marketing, Mirrored Media embodies the ethos and vision of today’s generation, reflecting a rapidly emerging trend of fearless, creative millennials on a mission to transform the attitude and framework of modern marketing. [“I think we’re very lucky, because we’re in a position to pick our clients and pick the projects we want to be a part of,”](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fonforb.es%2F1U8T8v3&text=%22I%20think%20we%27re%20very%20lucky%2C%20because%20we%27re%20in%20a%20position%20to%20pick%20our%20clients%20and%20the%20projects%20we%20want%20to%20be%20a%20part%20of.%22) stated Lefkovitch. “We work with clients that we really vibe well with, clients we can be a positive influence on, that listen to what we have to say, and want to truly create something really dope and creative.”
