Justin Lefkovitch, CEO and Founder of the award-winning experiential marketing agency Mirrored Media, celebrated his 30th birthday this past weekend. To mark the occasion, the Mirrored team threw a party of epic proportions at Hollywood’s famed Mack Sennett studios. The party featured a number of the company’s favorite and most popular activations, in addition to some new custom pieces made just for the event.

The invite-only party consisted of Mirrored’s extensive Fortune 500 client list, industry executives, friends and family, and many of LA’s finest, celebrities, and influencers. It featured live DJ sets by William Lifestyle, Laikipia, Nils “Nine Inch Nils” Montan, Ravell, Morgan Freed of Emo Nite, and Justin Lefkovitch himself, along with headliners Captain Cuts. Captain Cuts is a trio of producers who have composed and co-written with The Chainsmokers, Tove Lo, Grouplove, Halsey, Bebe Rexha, and Walk the Moon, garnering them several Billboard Music Award nominations and wins. They even invited special guests The Knocks to the stage for an exclusive sneak peek of a brand new song. All backline and sound equipment was provided by Swinghouse.

The party also featured surprise guest, and Justin’s management client Sofie Dossi. The 16-year-old influencer, contortionist, and America’s Got Talent finalist wowed the crowd with her performance, which culminated with her shooting a bow and arrow with her feet while standing on her hands. Sophie has been featured on Ellen, Disney’s Bizaardvark, and many others.

Mirrored Media is known as a leader and a pioneer in the world of experiential marketing, and Justin is well-known for his trademark man bun, even featured in the New York Times. The Mirrored team built a neon and man bun-inspired event to highlight the occasion. It featured a custom bounce house, floating 3D holograms, a step and repeat, a neon bar, a custom air hockey table, and a custom claw machine where guests could win manbun barbies, clip-in man buns, and other fun gifts fitting for the event. Guests were also encouraged to take selfies in the LED infinity room photo booth. There was also a large custom stage modeled after Justin’s profile and bun with a special neon Mirrored Media logo in the middle. Hovering over the stage was a custom-built LED cloud along with projection graphics and gobos on the cyc wall.

The open bar featured a custom cocktail menu with a cleverly-named drink created by each member of Mirrored Media. Guests enjoyed these creative concoctions provided by Ciroc and DeLeon tequila. A variety of flavored waters were also provided by Hint Water.

The party featured secret rooms and hidden adventures throughout the evening. Mirrored Media team members escorted a handful of guests through locked doors for a special experience where no photos or phones were allowed. The party raged on until 1am, with an after-party continuing until 4am. See all the user generated photos and videos by following #MirroredManBun, @MirroredMedia, and @Jlefkov.
