Mirrored Media brought hype to the Brooklyn Vegan showcase at the famous Red 7 located in the heart of the Red River Music District. The showcase brought 50 bands from around the world. Brooklyn Vegan SXSW drew over 6,000 people throughout the week, with a vibrant mix of music fans, artists, and industry tastemakers. Each day of the event series hit capacity and was amongst the most sought out day shows at SXSW. A day by day play below.

 

Day1:

The show kicked off with recent Run for Cover signee Elvis Depressedly, followed by folk-turned-pop musician Emmy the Great. Then it's the alt-R&B of Basecamp, the shiny pop of Yumi Zouma, indie veterans Frog Eyes, Canadian riff rockers Cancer Bats, power poppers Broncho, and finally Sub Pop sludge punks METZ and that was only on the inside stage.

Outside, the day started with the VU/Dead stylings of Ultimate Painting (members of Mazes and Veronica Falls), into the young, smart and quickly rising duo Girlpool. They were followed by intense Irish noisemakers Girl Band, then jangly Seattle post-punks Chastity Belt, arty/folky indie rocker Mitski, discordant indie rockers Speedy Ortiz, and we wrapped up the day is Austin experimental rockers The Octopus Project.

Day 2:

On Friday inside show began with Walter Schreifels' (of Gorilla Biscuits, Quicksand, Rival Schools, etc) new band with two Trail of Dead members, [Vanishing Life](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/09/vanshing_life_w.html), followed by a full-band set by long-running singer/songwriter Kevin Devine (who's in the midst of a [series of splits](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2015/02/meredith_graves.html) with Nada Surf's Matthew Caws, Perfect Pussy's Meredith Graves and more). Then came The Velvet Teen, who just announced [their first LP](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2015/03/the_velvet_teen_3.html) since 2006 on Topshelf Records. After that, the inside stage got heavier, with snotty Canadian punks Single Mothers, sludgey post-hardcore band KEN mode, crossover thrashers Power Trip, and finally the screamo band of former Thursday singer Geoff Rickly, United Nations.

Outside, the day began with Philly shoegazers Creepoid (who have a [new LP](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2015/03/creepoid_announ.html) coming), followed by Rat Fist, the [new-ish punk band](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2014/06/rat_fist_no_age.html) with No Age and Pissed Jeans members. Then it was Swedish post-punks Makthaverskan, their shoegazey Run for Cover labelmates Pity Sex, and atmospheric post-hardcore band Pianos Become the Teeth (who also have members in United Nations). The day wrapped up with two veterans: Superchunk frontman Mac McCaughan (who has his [debut solo LP](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2015/02/mac_mccaughan_s.html) on the way) and [reunited](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2015/02/swervedriver_ex.html) shoegazers Swervedriver.
