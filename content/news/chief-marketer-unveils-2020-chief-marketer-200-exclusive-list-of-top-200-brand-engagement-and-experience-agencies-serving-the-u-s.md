Norwalk, CT, November 26, 2019 – Chief Marketer, a leading publisher of content, recognition programs and training events for Fortune 1000 marketers, today unveiled the 2020 Chief Marketer 200. It is the world’s only editorial listing of best-in-class brand engagement and activation agencies.

The CM200 features editorial listings and coverage of agencies spanning 11 categories, including Experiential, Sports & Entertainment, Promotion, Retail/Shopper, Digital/Content, Social Media, Design and Innovation, B2B Demand Gen, B2B Brand Engagement Marketing, B2B Experiential Marketing and Martech. Editorial profiles include details on core capabilities and specializations, examples of outstanding work, insights on culture and people, client examples and RFP contact information.

“Many of the marketing disciplines that were once considered ‘below the line’ have come into their own and become some of the most powerful marketing tools in the marketing mix,” says Jessica Heasley, Group Editor & Publisher at Chief Marketer. “We created the CM200 three years ago to shine a spotlight on this vibrant and fast-growing agency community, and to help modern marketers find the partners that will help them craft the kind of campaigns that modern consumers demand.”

Chief Marketer’s editors accepted applications from across the country for the CM200 earlier this fall. Winners were selected based on several criteria including: insightful client testimonials; outstanding case study submissions; high caliber, consistent work across programs and clients; innovative and creative executions; and bold and inspiring concepts and ideas that are moving the industry forward. The 200 agencies selected for this year’s program are thought leaders in their craft and representative of the best of the marketing industry.
