Mirrored Media teamed up with Hollywood Records, PhilyMack, and Bea Miller to produce a truly one of a kind music video release screening event. The event gave fans a first look at Bea's newest single, "Yes Girl" and was hosted by Just Jared. The event included 'tea with Bea', drinks, snacks, a custom photo booth, screening, Q&A, photo ops, and a meet and greet. Mirrored Media helped to recreate a scene from the music video live in person for fans to experience. 

**"Bea Miller** takes the stage to introduce her brand new **_“Yes Girl”_** music video at the premiere event held at Beacher’s Madhouse inside the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on Wednesday evening (August 24) in Los Angeles.

The 17-year-old songstress talked about the track in depth during a Q&A hosted by **JustJared.com**‘s own **Jared Eng**.

“Yes Girl” is about having a relationship with anybody who is incredibly controlling,” **Bea** said about the song. “It’s about overcoming that and realizing you don’t need them in your life anymore.”

She added, “The strings are representative of people in my life who need things from me constantly, who make me feel like I’m tied down to \[them\] in a literal sense. The video visually brings that feeling and struggle to life.

The video was directed by **Aya Tanimura** and shot in Los Angeles." - JustJared.com
