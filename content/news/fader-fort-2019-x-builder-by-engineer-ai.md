Mirrored Media is excited to announce that we will be bringing Builder by Engineer.ai to SXSW this year. Builder has teamed up with Fader to provide a custom RSVP backend for SXSW's most anticipated event, Fader Fort.

The FADER FORT is returning to Austin, Texas for its 17th consecutive year, from March 13-15. This year's line-up includes Megan Thee Stallion, Omar Apollo, Charly Bliss, Queen Key, Novelist, Lil Gotit, and many more to be announced.

In addition to providing live programming from daytime into the evening, FADER FORT and Spotify Premium will be introducing panel programming for the first-time ever at the festival, accessible to Spotify Premium subscribers. Further details on the panels, and more at FADER FORT including additional artist performances, will be announced at a later date.  
As in previous years, FADER FORT will be a guest list-only event, with invites received via email. There will be no public RSVP, and private invites will be non-transferable. FADER FORT's custom RSVP is powered by **Builder by Engineer.ai**, the future of app development.

The FADER FORT is made possible this year by FORT partners Austin FC, INTRINSIC Wine Co, RED Hydrogen, SmartWater, Spotify Premium, TikTok, Select, and Xbox.FADER is also partnering up with Compound — a cutting edge gallery and creative space in The Bronx — for a one-night photo exhibition celebrating our new photo book, _Setting The Stage_, on March 7.
