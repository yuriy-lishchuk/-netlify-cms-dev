Just announced: we are excited about our August lineup of musicians at the Anaheim Marriot's NFUSE Bar & Kitchen! A part of our mission with Anaheim Sessions is to spotlight the up-and-coming singers and songwriters that you should know.

This month we have some of our favorites back to warm up the Anaheim Marriott, as well as newcomers! Welcome back the ever-hardworking [Katie Stump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fswZzhbuhN0), the easygoing [Matt Koelsch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev_zE8Suq_0), storyteller [Jesse Macht](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGD86Gnpl2c), and guitar aficionado [Mike West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8D8xcxMykog). And get to know the lovely [Drew Tabor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p6rJm43fV8), covering your favorite pop songs with incredible grace, and [OSO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4jaquNiAWs), bringing back guitar jams with a warm soul.

Check out the flyer below to see when these artists will be at NFUSE Bar and Kitchen!
