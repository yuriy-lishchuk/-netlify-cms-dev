At the 2017 edition of Sundance Film Festival, The Hub at Park City Live was the talk of Main Street for VIP guests and celebrities alike. Produced by Mirrored Media in partnership with Fingerprint Communications, The Hub featured a wide array of brands and activations over the long weekend, including Splenda, the Consumer Technology Association, AwesomenessTV, 361, Cool Effect, Tanqueray, Twitter, Movie Pilot, musical.ly, Marie Claire, and Spotify. 

The convenient location of Park City Live allowed festival VIPs and celebrities to stop in for a brief respite from the snowy bustle of Main Street. Guests in attendance included Chelsea Handler, Charlize Theron, Mary McCormack, Bebe Rexha, Emmanuelle Chriqui, Annabelle Dexter-Jones, Aisha Tyler, Kate Micucci, Brock O'Hurn, Teresa Palmer, Max Riemelt, Olivia Culpo, and more.

Each brand delivered a unique guest experience for both daytime activations and nighttime events:

**The Consumer Technology Association** featured nine 4K UHD TVs throughout the venue. Each one looped exclusive 4K content to showcase the visually stunning detail and clarity of 4K technology. CTA hosted a reception for one of the Sundance films shot in 4K UHD, _Chasing Coral_, which was picked up by Netlfix after its premiere at the festival.
