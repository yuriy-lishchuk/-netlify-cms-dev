Mirrored Media is proud to congratulate our very own Tayler Schaut for winning one of LASSO's Top Women in Events for 2019

“The world needs strong women. Women who will lift and build others, who will love and be loved. Women who live bravely, both tender and fierce. Women of indomitable will.” ~ Amy Tenney

"The event industry is both intense and competitive, but it is also incredibly rewarding. While it takes hard work and dedication, event professionals also get the unique opportunity to make the most exciting and lasting experiences come to life. Many women are breaking through the industry’s glass ceiling and are paving the way for a more diverse and equal landscape. Things are changing. Women play an incredibly important role in this industry – driving both value and inspiration to ensure successful events. LASSO wants to take the opportunity to recognize these top performing, well-deserving women.

Last year, LASSO launched our first annual “Top Women in Events” awards where we aimed to recognize some of the most hard-working and talented women in the industry. Today, we are more excited than ever to announce the 2019 winners. Similar to last year, this year we asked our network of the very best event companies for nominations on who they thought should be recognized. The response was inspiring. We received over 100 nominations of amazing women that make an impact on this industry day in and day out. It was difficult to narrow these nominations down to highlight the Top 50. We are excited to highlight these powerhouse women. They deserve to be acknowledged because of their positive impact on growth and the success of their teams. "

Congrats to Tayler and all 50 women. See all of the winners [HERE](https://www.lasso.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Women-In-Events-2019-FINAL.pdf).
