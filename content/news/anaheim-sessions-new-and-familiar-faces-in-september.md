And now, your September artist lineup of #AnaheimSessions! We are so excited to welcome back Drew Tabor, OSO, and Mike West to Anaheim Marriott's nFuse Lounge as well as introduce you to Leeann Skoba!

Anaheim Sessions is a continuing monthly songwriter showcase hosted by the Anaheim Marriott. It is an opportunity for us to create a stage for songwriters throughout Souther California to grow a fanbase and show off their talent. Stop by nFuse Lounge this month to catch some of our favorites!
