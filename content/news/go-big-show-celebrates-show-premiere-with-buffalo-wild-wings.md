### TBS partners with Buffalo Wild Wings to debut the GO-BIG Bundle in anticipation of the upcoming series premiere of _GO-BIG SHOW_.

In order to promote the January 7th premiere of GO-BIG SHOW, the most extreme talent competition ever, Mirrored Media worked with TBS to team up with nationwide CDR juggernaut, Buffalo Wild Wings, to create the GO-BIG BUNDLE. The bundle features 20 traditional wings, 20 boneless wings, and fries for just $39.99.

To build awareness and anticipation for the upcoming series hosted by Bert Kreischer alongside celebrity judges Snoop Dogg, Jennifer Nettles, Rosario Dawson, and Cody Rhodes, consumers nationwide will be able to order the Go-Big Show Wing Bundle by placing an order on BuffaloWildWings.com or by ordering through the Buffalo Wild Wings app from January 2nd through the season finale on March 11th.

Furthermore, TBS has tapped host (and Buffalo Wild Wings fanatic) Bert Kreischer to kick off the campaign with a launch video promoting the partnership to his fan base. Both brands will support the co-branded effort with digital, in app, social media, and newsletter support as well as extended continuity support throughout the season resulting in significant earned media for both brands.

Be sure to order the new GO-BIG BUNDLE from Buffalo Wild Wings starting January 2nd and catch the series premiere of GO-BIG SHOW on TBS on January 7th at 9/8c.
