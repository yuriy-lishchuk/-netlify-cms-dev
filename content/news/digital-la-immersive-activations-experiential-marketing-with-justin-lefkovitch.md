Immersive Activations that transport you to another world are being increasingly used by Hollywood movie studios, brand marketers and advertisers to generate excitement and create social media opportunities. Join us for our panel with award-winning founders of LA's leading immersive activation and experiential marketing agencies, who created some of the biggest buzzed-about activations at SXSW, San Diego Comic-Con and VidCon this year.

Our discussion will focus on how these agencies work with studios and advertisers to create never-been-done-before out-of-the-box experiences that fit the movie, show, or brand perfectly, and make fans and influencers want to share on their social. We will also focus on how tech like RFID wristbands and tablets can improve registration, throughput, and email/texting delivery of social media photos and videos. And how new tech like VR, AR, and more can be used successfully.
