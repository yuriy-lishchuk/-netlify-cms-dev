Have you seen the Acura ILX Installation car? Â The innovative Acura ILX is a car that defines technological refinement. Metric's new album "Synthetica" is set to a sound that blends technology and nature. To highlight this partnership, we took the Acura ILX on the road with Metric and hit several cities across the country.

In addition to the great music that fans heard from Metric and the great experience they had with the ILX, we took with us something awesome, a one of a kind ILX car installation. State of the art projection mapping and LED display lights worked together to give a 3D experience inside the car. Check out the video of this Acura ILX car installation, set to the awesome tunes of Metric!
