Mirrored Media teamed up with Fullscreen and 20th Century Fox to produce one of SxSW's most buzzed about events and press junkets for Fox's new movie, Spy. The Mirrored team started the day off producing press interviews with the star studded cast Rose Byrne, Jason Statham, Melissa McCarthy, Bobby Cannavale, and more.

Later that night, Mirrored converted The Market in Austin into a top secret CIA spy headquarters. Here, guests enjoyed live music from Questlove, lasers, drinks, photo booths, and an engaging social media game. The evening hosted guests from the Chairman of Fox, to Mark Cuban, and even Guillermo Rodriguez.
