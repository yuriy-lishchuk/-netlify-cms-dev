On Thursday, Mirrored Media teamed up with ACID Cigar to throw a private launch party for the newest ACID cigarillos. Friends, family, and tastemakers throughout Los Angeles came to the Bardot for an evening of food, cocktails, and special live performances by Fantastic Negrito and Wale. As the Bardot quickly reached capacity, guests were also surprised with photo opportunities, a live graffiti artist, a DJ set from William Lifestyle, gift bags, and booths throughout the venue with free samples of ACID’s newest line of cigarillos. We are excited to experienced ACID cigarillos through such a memorable party!

Many thanks to Preston Thalindroma for taking photos of our event all evening!
