Mirrored Media is proud to announce that it has won a 2017 Summit International Emerging Media Award with AwesomenessTV for the Vidcon ball pit. This is the second year in a row that Mirrored Media has taken home an Emerging Media award.

## 2017 Emerging Media Awards:

### [AwesomenessTV Vidcon Ball Pit: Emerging Media Award – Leader – Trade Show](https://summitawards.com/past-mea-awards-listings/)

#### **Awesomeness Ball Pit Presented by Live.me:** 

This one-of-a-kind custom ball pit activation featured an 8’x10′ pit with 20,000 balls in branded colors of teal pink, and purple. It offered a unique shareable photo element in which users were captured in slow-mo video from a truss above as they free fall backwards into the pit. The branded video content can then be shared through two iPad stations instantly via all social media platforms. The pit and truss were each covered in co-branded signage from Awesomeness and Live.me.

The ball pit also featured a live stream presented presented by Live.me, including a TV on site so fans in line could watch the action as they waited. Guests were also encouraged to download the Live.me app if they didn’t have it already, which gave them access to a VIP fast lane into the pit.
