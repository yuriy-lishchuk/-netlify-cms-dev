Just hours before their season 3 premiere on Sunday, the cast of _Summer Break_ stopped by the AT&T store in Santa Monica to meet a few hundred of their biggest fans in Los Angeles. Mirrored Media worked with Fullscreen to host the event, from setting up the store to creating memorable activations for everyone who waited all morning to meet their favorite cast members.

Once the event began, the _Summer Break_ cast gifted 15 lucky fans with autographed gold Beats Pills as well as the first selfies and hugs. Fans afterwards were also surprised with gift boxes of t-shirts, hats, beanies, and sweatbands, as well as visits from a few stars from _Summer Break 2_. During the meet and greet, the _Summer Break_ cast led groups to a nearby ice cream truck, where they helped to pick out themed ice cream and snow cone flavors for their fans. Not an hour went by without a crazy surprise around the corner!

_Summer Break_'s social team was present to take great pictures of the event. Special thanks to AT&T and Fullscreen for organizing the most interactive meet and greets we have ever seen.
