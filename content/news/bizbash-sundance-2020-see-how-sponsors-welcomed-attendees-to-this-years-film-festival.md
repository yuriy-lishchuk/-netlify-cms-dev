This year, United Talent Agency expanded its festival footprint, hosting three days of programming at a private residence. Guests, clients, and industry professionals attended a lineup of events such as the agency’s annual brand leaders dinner; Women In Film’s reception panel; and UTA client Issa Rae’s celebration in honor of Creators of Color. UTA Marketing, the agency’s entertainment consulting practice that represents global brands including Cover Girl, Delta Air Lines, General Motors, General Mills, Google, and Lyft, led the agency’s programming this year.
