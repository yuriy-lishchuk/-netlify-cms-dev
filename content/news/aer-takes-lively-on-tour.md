One of the reasons Lively was started was to give fans the whole experience of live shows.  Part of that is the organic growth that live shows undergo while on the road.  You can see your favorite artists grow with the songs you love.  AER kicks off their 2014 tour with a House of Blues show, which now you can get with any of the other shows you purchase on Lively! Download any show on the tour, and you automatically get the video from House of Blues. Get to know AER a little better as they travel around the country.
