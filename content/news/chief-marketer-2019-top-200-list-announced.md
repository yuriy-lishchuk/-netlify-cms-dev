Chief Marketer 2019 Top 200 

**CHIEF MARKETER UNVEILS 2019 CHIEF MARKETER 200: EXCLUSIVE LIST OF TOP 200 NON-ADVERTISING AGENCIES SERVING THE U.S.**

_Industry’s only comprehensive list of the best engagement and activation agencies across 11 partner categories and specialties shines spotlight on the fastest-growing channels of marketing_

**Norwalk, CT, December 17, 2018** – Chief Marketer, a leading publisher of content, recognition programs and training events for Fortune 1000 marketers, today unveiled the 2019 Chief Marketer 200. It is the world’s only editorial list of best-in-class non- advertising agencies. **Mirrored Media** is proud to be named as one of the top marketing agencies on this list. 

The CM200 features editorial listings and coverage of agencies spanning 11 categories, including Experiential, Sports & Entertainment, Promotion, Retail/Shopper, Digital/Content, Social Media, Design and Innovation, B2B Demand Gen, B2B Brand Engagement Marketing, B2B Experiential Marketing and Martech. Editorial profiles include details on core capabilities and specializations, examples of outstanding work, insights on culture and people, client examples and RFP contact information.

“Today’s marketer relies on a toolkit of new technologies and tools that emphasize engagement and experiences above advertising techniques that merely talk to, rather than with, the customer,” says Jessica Heasley, Content Director at Chief Marketer. “The Chief Marketer 200 serves as an invaluable resource for marketers seeking to engage the right partners to help them craft meaningful—and measurable—campaigns and strategies.”Chief Marketer’s editors accepted applications from across the country for the CM200 earlier this fall. Winners were selected based on several criteria including: insightful client testimonials; outstanding case study submissions; high caliber, consistent work across programs and clients; innovative and creative executions; and bold and inspiring concepts and ideas that are moving the industry forward. The 200 agencies selected for this year’s program are thought leaders in their craft and representative of the best of the marketing industry.**A**
