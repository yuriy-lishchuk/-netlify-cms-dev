A lineup so stacked, our hearts are thumping with excitement! We've got a great mix of familiar and new faces who will take the singer-songwriter stage at Anaheim Marriott’s nFuse Lounge in October. It's looking like a pretty busy month ahead for us music lovers.

Anaheim Sessions is a continuing monthly songwriter showcase hosted by the Anaheim Marriott. It is an opportunity for us to create a stage for songwriters throughout Souther California to grow a fanbase and show off their talent. Stop by nFuse Lounge this month to catch some of our favorites!
