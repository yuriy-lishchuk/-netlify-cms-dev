Mirrored Media has partnered with Fullscreen, Live.Me, and JCPenney on the 2016 Girls Night In Tour. Niki & Gabi, Alisha Marie, Jessie Paege and Alyson Stoner are leading the GNI charge this year with a national tour. The sponsors for Girls Night In include retailer JCPenney and live streaming app Live.me. JCPenney will be featured in the show itself, where lucky audience members will receive styling sessions. In addition, select JCPenney stores will host Q&A events with cast members produced by Mirrored Media. The Live.me app will feature behind-the-scenes live content from the cast at each event and throughout the tour. Lucky fans in select markets will also have the opportunity to join a Live.me influencer meet up produced by Mirrored Media.
