We are excited to announce that we have teamed up with the American luxury fashion brand Coach forÂ their new Fall line release. "The iconic heritage brand has changed dramatically this year. After taking a look into the archives of the most classic handbag silhouettes and reinterpreting them with moto-esque elements and updated hardware, along with a fresh approach to apparel (most noteworthy, outerwear), Vevers somehow transformed Coach from your mom's favorite label to a total cool-girl staple" says [Refinery29](http://www.refinery29.com/2014/08/73568/new-coach-fall-2014-line?collection=197#slide).

As Coach focuses on a younger influential demographic, Mirrored Media will help to align key influential artists with Coach's new 2014 Fall interactive Instagram based look book.
