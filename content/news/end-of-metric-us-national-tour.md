On Monday night Metric wrapped up their 23 date US National tour in Tempe, AZ.  Two lucky winners in every city got to join Acura and the ILX on tour to have a one of a kind VIP tour experience with Metric.  The winners had the opportunity to go backstage, hang out with the band, get signed merchandise with photos and see the concert up close and personal.  To see all the photos check out Metric's Facebook page [here](https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151085108874370.450629.6920564369&type=1).  Make sure to follow the campaign on twitter with #ILXMetric and on Instagram.
