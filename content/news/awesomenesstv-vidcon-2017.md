# **Awesomeness Ball Pit Presented by Live.me:** 

This one-of-a-kind custom ball pit activation featured an 8'x10' pit with 20,000 balls in branded colors of teal pink, and purple. It offered a unique shareable photo element in which users were captured in slow-mo video from a truss above as they free fall backwards into the pit. The branded video content can then be shared through two iPad stations instantly via all social media platforms. The pit and truss were each covered in co-branded signage from Awesomeness and Live.me.

The ball pit also featured a live stream presented presented by Live.me, including a TV on site so fans in line could watch the action as they waited. Guests were also encouraged to download the Live.me app if they didn't have it already, which gave them access to a VIP fast lane into the pit.

The focal point for fans just before entering the convention center was the Awesomeness Ferris wheel. provided fans with the best views of VidCon along with the perfect selfie opportunity from high above the convention center's Grand Plaza.

# **Awesomeness Oasis:**

VidCon consists of hot days, long nights, and huge crowds. This can be a strenuous week for anyone, but even more so for talent. The Awesomeness Oasis at the Hyatt Regency provided the perfect respite for all of the brand's talent in attendance. Located five minutes south of the convention center, the Oasis contained comfortable couches and chairs, food and drinks, a gifting station presented by Hollister, Awesomeness-branded content on TV, massage stations, and a floral living wall with branded neon signs for the perfect photo opportunity.

_Access Hollywood_ also had a space inside the Oasis where they interviewed talent to air on TV and social media each day as they came through.

# **Awesomeness + Invisalign Screening & After Party:**

Invisalign and Awesomeness teamed up again on the very popular Friday night of VidCon to present a screening of original content followed by an after-party. All of this took place at the Sheraton Park Hotel, which is just steps away from the Anaheim Convention Center.

The evening began at 7pm with a screening of three short content pieces in the Sheraton's beautiful Tiffany Terrace. A branded step and repeat and a blue carpet greeted guests as they walked into the room. The hour-long screening, which hosted 100 guests, featured drinks, popcorn, and even candy apples!

After the screening finished, the after-party began on the adjacent Tiffany Patio. Attendees included many Invisalign and Awesomeness employees and executives, VIP guests, and Awesomeness talent.

The 8-11pm event featured two open bars, catered appetizers and desserts, a DJ, branded giant Jenga, branded corn hole, and a picturesque hedge wall with die-cut brand logos, creating the perfect Instagrammable moment.

# **Awesomeness Mirror Letters and Chalkboard:**

In addition to these larger activations, Mirrored Media also took on the management and setup of Awesomeness' signature mirror letters, which stretch almost 15 feet across and create the perfect photo opportunity for fans about to enter the convention center. Placed just to the right of the prominent Grand Plaza fountain, and adjacent to the Ferris wheel and ball pit, the letters were a huge hit on site.

Even more attention-grabbing was the Awesomeness chalk wall. Placed across from the the Ferris wheel, the board had the headline "What Makes You Awesome?". Fans were encouraged to write their own responses with the chalk provided. The front, back, and sides of the wall were covered within a few short hours! Fans absolutely loved coming up with their own creative ideas to share with the rest of VidCon. We would periodically wash the wall so fans could start over, but each time, it was fully covered in just a few short hours.
