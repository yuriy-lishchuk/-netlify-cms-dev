Sour Patch Kids teamed up with Fullscreen to launch its new "Breaking Out" video series back in October 2014,  and since then, the first branded show to cast a group of YouTube stars as scripted characters has been a hit!

Fullscreen and Sour Patch Kids partnered with Mirrored Media for a second year to throw a prom at the Loews Hotel, in Santa Monica, CA.  On Saturday May 30, social media superstars Andrea Russett, Meredith Foster, Jack Gilinsky and Jack Johnson appeared at Loews to meet their sweeps winner prom dates!

Fans chose their favorite YouTube star and asked them to prom by using the hashtag **#SPKpromposal** which equals: asking a person you watch online ALL THE TIME to the SPK Prom in L.A. in a super romantic or crazy funny way.

The winners were not only able to meet their favorite stars, but they partied at the SPK PROM with the celeb they promposed to, enjoyed a Q&A about their upcoming series, and received some exclusive SPK merchandise and candy! Oh, we can't forget the part where they were able to jump into the photo booth with their favorite star. It was a huge success!
