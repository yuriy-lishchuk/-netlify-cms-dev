Billboard via Andrew Hampp writes:

"MGMT and Grimes are heading to San Diego's 2014 Comic-Con International, where MGMT will play a live set and Grimes will DJ at a party for [CraveOnline](http://www.Craveonline.com "Craveonline") on July 25. The event will take place aboard the USS Midway, an aircraft carrier docked adjacent to the Convention Center, and appropriately enough TNT's "The Last Ship" will sponsor.  
   
Though Comic-Con has primarily been a destination for movie studios and TV networks to hype their latest franchises in recent years, it's become a rising priority for the music industry to capitalize on all the fan activity. Metallica played a surprise show last year in support of their pseudo-documentary "Metallica Through The Never," while [VH1 Classic recruited Rob Zombie to play the first-ever Opening Party](http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/tv-film/1093098/exclusive-vh1-classic-rob-zombie-to-host-first-ever-comic-con) in 2012. Also on tap for Comic-Con 2014 are G-Eazy and Linkin Park, who will [perform at MTV's Fan Fest](http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6143191/g-eazy-linkin-park-mtv-fan-fest-mtvu-fandom-comic-con) on Thursday, July 24. 
   
The CraveOnline event is produced and booked by **Mirrored Media**, an L.A.-based music marketing company that has previously paired Metric with Acura for a fall 2012 tour and mobile-charging brand Mophie with key festivals like Life Is Beautiful, Coachella and Lollapalooza."
