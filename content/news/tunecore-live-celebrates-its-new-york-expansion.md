On Wednesday, TuneCore drew hundreds of New Yorkers to its very first Brooklyn edition of TuneCore Live at the Living Room. We are excited to have witnessed the inaugural monthly showcase for ourselves, as we once again joined TuneCore as producers of the party.

The inaugural event will be remembered for the incredible performances by [18th & Addison](https://www.facebook.com/18thandAddison), [BRAEVES](https://www.facebook.com/braevesband?fref=nf), and [PigPen Theatre Co.](https://www.facebook.com/PigPenTheatreCo), with Broad City’s very own music supervisor, [Matt FX](https://twitter.com/mattfxfxfxfx), amplifying the room in between sets.

Attendees began pouring into the Living Room upon open, admiring the city view from the venue’s rooftop patio, making new friends, and exploring the [Swisher Sweets](http://swishersweets.com) table, who are once again proud sponsors of TuneCore Live: Brooklyn.

We are excited by the turnout and the free spirit of New Yorkers, curious about music and the community of artists that inhabit Brooklyn. Though our home office is in Los Angeles, we hope to be back as frequently as possible to catch the excitement of Brooklyn’s TuneCore Live again.

Until then, we hope New York has a blast at next month’s TuneCore Live!
