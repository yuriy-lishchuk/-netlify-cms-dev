Introducing the BizBash 1,000, the people with the biggest impact on meetings and events across the United States. These individuals plan everything from galas for national art museums to massive trade shows, pop culture conventions, and festivals. They also produce and design Instagram-worthy events for big brands, live music productions, and sporting events, as well as multimillion-dollar weddings. Some of them offer innovative (and mouthwatering) food and beverage ideas, while others provide education programs and strategy tips that benefit everyone in the industry. It was our mission to celebrate the best of the best in a diverse and growing industry, while offering a compilation of people to connect with for ideas, inspiration, or guidance for your future events.

Mirrored Media CEO/Founder Justin Lefkovitch was named to this list alongside other highly respected industry professionals in varied segments of the events industry.
