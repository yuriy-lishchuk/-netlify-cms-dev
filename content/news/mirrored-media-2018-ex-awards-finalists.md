Mirrored Media is excited to announce that our BMW Road to Coachella campaign has made it to the finals of the 2018 Ex Awards. The best experiential campaigns in the world will be named May 14 in San Francisco.

**BEST FAIR/FESTIVAL ACTIVATION** Client: BMW Campaign: Road to Coachella Agency: Mirrored Media

For more than 15 years, the Ex Awards has remained the largest recognition program for best-in-class experiential marketing. This year’s finalists, just unveiled, represent the most innovative brands and agencies in the industry.

The editors of Event Marketer have announced this year’s Ex Awards finalists, the 2018 best experiential marketing campaigns in the world. Entries this year broke all previous records—more than 1,000 were received from all over the world and there were more tie-breaks during scoring than ever before. One judge may have said it best: “This was the best work ever entered into the Ex Awards and the hardest year to win… ever.”

The Ex Awards is still the only marketing recognition program on the planet judged entirely by client-side judges—more than two-dozen scored entries over the last three weeks.
