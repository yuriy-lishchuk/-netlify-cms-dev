Experiential marketing [is on the radar](https://blog.ebiquity.com/2016/12/the-power-of-the-pop-up-breaking-down-the-popularity-of-experiential-marketing) of most marketers, as brands strive to tap into our generation craving [real life experiences](https://www.inc.com/jeff-barrett/brick-and-mortar-retail-isnt-dead-you-can-save-it-.html?cid=search). Many brands have already put serious effort into building and growing their online presence, but they're often missing the [in-person element](https://www.inc.com/entrepreneurs-organization/the-human-element-how-strong-relationships-lead-to-business-success.html?cid=search). Investing in branded experiential marketing that lets customers create memories in person, rather than simply watching a demo or looking at pictures, has proven to be one of the best [marketing expenses](https://www.inc.com/aaron-aders/digital-marketing-pro-tips-how-enterprises-win-customers.html?cid=search) for many brands.
