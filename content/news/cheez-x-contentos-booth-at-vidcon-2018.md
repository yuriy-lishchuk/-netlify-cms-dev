The Cheez booth gave guests a chance to see their favorite Cheez creators live on the Cheez stage and also engage with the app personally both on stage and on the dance challenge challenge stage.

Led by an energetic emcee, the build featured a stage surrounded by mylar walls, custom lighting, and a colorful branded exterior wall. There was also a dance challenge stage where guests stepped in front of the app to try their best dance moves while a screen allowed everyone to see the in-app experience as well. Staff roamed around to capture the perfect Polaroid photos of guests, which were then added to the physical "blockchain” for Contentos.
