### How to Build a Profitable Music App (Legally)

You have an idea for a music app, and now all you need to do is talk to the labels about licensing their songs, build a back-end platform to host them, figure out how to make money, and avoid a lawsuit from the RIAA. Is that all? Developers and music pros demonstrate how to build successful apps that license and host music legally.

The panel will be moderated by **Brian Hirsh**, chief creative officer of Mirrored Media. Panel participants include: Eric Davich, chief content officer & co-founder of **Songza Media Inc**, Cindy Charles, president of **Cidy Charles Consulting**, Frank Johnson, CEO of **MediaNet**, and Cheryl Lucanegro, VP of advertising strategy & sales for **SoundHound**.

The panel will take place on Wednesday, March 13th from 11:00AM -12:00PM at the Austin Convention Center, room 9ABC. Make sure to check it out if you are in Austin for SXSW.
