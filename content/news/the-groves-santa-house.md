For the 2019 holiday season, Caruso and The Grove partnered with Mirrored Media to reimagine The Grove's Santa House. The building is modeled as Santa's workshop, and is placed in the center of the iconic Los Angeles shopping center. To update the structure while keeping the charm and whimsical feel of the workshop, the Mirrored team worked with Caruso and partners to create a design that integrated a classic Christmas color palette, candy cane and gingerbread patterns, and playful animatronic characters that welcomed families to the "Winter Wonderland at The Grove". The roof is covered in realistic snow to help set the scene for Santa's house for Angelenos.

Throughout the holiday season, children can visit Santa and share their Christmas wishlists, while having professional photos taken of this unforgettable experience.

Guests can make a reservation to see Santa and have photos taken [HERE.](https://thegrovela.com/reservation/)
