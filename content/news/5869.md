Hermes Creative Awards is an international competition for creative professionals involved in the concept, writing and design of traditional and emerging media. Hermes Creative Awards recognizes outstanding work in the industry while promoting the philanthropic nature of marketing and communication professionals.

Hermes Creative Awards is administered by the Association of Marketing and Communication Professionals (www.amcpros.com). The international organization consists of several thousand marketing, communication, advertising, public relations, digital media production and free-lance professionals. AMCP oversees awards and recognition programs, provides judges and awards outstanding achievement and service to the profession.

As part of its mission, AMCP fosters and supports the efforts of creative professionals who contribute their unique talents to public service and charitable organizations. Hermes entrants are not charged to enter work they produced pro bono. Over the past few years, AMCP’s Advisory Board has given out over $250,000 in grants to support philanthropic endeavors.

Judges are industry professionals who look for companies and individuals whose talent exceeds a high standard of excellence and whose work serves as a benchmark for the industry. There are expected to be about 6,000 entries from throughout the United States and many other countries in the Hermes Creative Awards 2018 competition.  In the past, about 15 percent of entries won Platinum, the top award and around 20 percent the Gold Award. Approximately 10 percent were Honorable Mention winners.

Being a Platinum or Gold Winner is a tremendous achievement that is symbolized by the intricately detailed Hermes Platinum and Gold awards. The name Hermes (Greek messenger) and the idea for the award were chosen to represent our roles as the messengers and creators of marketing and communication materials and programs.
