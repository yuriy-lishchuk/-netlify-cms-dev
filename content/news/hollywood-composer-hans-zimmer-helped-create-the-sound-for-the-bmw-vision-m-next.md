Hollywood composer **Hans Zimmer** is known for the countless soundtracks he’s worked on for films including _Pirates of the Caribbean_, _The Lion King_, _Inception_, _The Dark Knight_, _Pearl Harbor_ and more.

Now, he’s taking his musical skills to another forum — cars. The award-winning record producer teamed up with **Renzo Vitale**, acoustic engineer and sound designer at the BMW Group, to compose the sound for the [BMW Vision M NEXT Opens a New Window.](https://www.bmw.com/en/innovation/bmw-vision-m-next.html)Sports Car.

“I have always been a BMW enthusiast. As a kid I used to recognise my mother coming home by the sound of her BMW. I am thrilled to get the chance to design the sound of future electric BMW’s and create emotion for the future electric driving experience,” he said in a press release.

BMW Vision M NEXT drivers can expect to use all of their senses while getting around from place to place. 

“When the driver interacts with the accelerator pedal it is not only a mechanical touchpoint, but also a performative element. Accelerating becomes an experience during which the driver moves through a series of gradually morphing sound textures,” Zimmer added. 

The composer and Vitale created these unique sounds for the BMW Vision M NEXT in Zimmer’s studios in London and L.A. with the intention of bringing a new way to engage drivers.

“We envision sounds that celebrate the beauty and complexity of our vehicles and that are able to move people. I see designing people’s future acoustic environment both as a privilege and as a responsibility,” Vitale said.

“The development and composition for the sound of the Vision M NEXT was mainly inspired by light installations from **James Turrell** and **Ólafur Elíasson**. In particular, Turrell realized works known for the illusion of an infinite space, which creates a magical experience for the spectator. The idea behind the Vision M NEXT is to recreate this sense of wonder through sound,” Vitale continued. 

The [partnershipOpens a New Window.](https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/NEXTGen/iconic_sounds.html) was curated by the experiential agency [Mirrored MediaOpens a New Window.](http://www.mirroredmedia.com/). The BMW Vision M NEXT car debuted at BMW’s tech conference, the BMW Group #NEXTGen, in Munich on June 25, 2019 and the company plans to offer at least 25 electrified vehicles by 2023.
