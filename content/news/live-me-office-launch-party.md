# Live.Me Office Launch Party

In October 2017, live broadcasting platform Live.me moved to a spacious, modern new office in West Hollywood. Mirrored Media played an integral part in curating, designing, and installing many of the spaceâ€™s new features. 

The new Live.me office is not just a workspace, but also a hub for creators and influencers to film and generate content. In the large front room, our team installed a large pink stage with printed SEG graphic walls, which acts as a focal point of the space and one of two major areas for content. The other is an Met Gala-inspired LED photo booth that is built seamlessly under the stairs. This mirrored reflective booth contains strips of programmable colored LED lights in a mesmerizing pattern, creating an endless light design that allows for a unique, shareable photo opp. The office also houses an arcade-style claw machine built to Live.me specifications, presenting the perfect opportunity to give away premiums and other swag in a fun way.

In the rear lounge, a floating and rotating 3D Live.me hologram sits just above the doorway. This fully-programmable hologram unit can display any type of 3D design, giving Live.me an endless amount of creative possibilities for different occasions.

Once the new office was up and running, Live.me wanted to throw a party to celebrate. As it was just a few days before Halloween, they teamed up with Mirrored to host a themed costume party. The invite-only bash featured music from DJ William Lifestyle on the new stage, programmed light trees and moving heads, a custom sound system installation, and a myriad of zombies, ghouls, spiderwebs, and other spooky decor.
