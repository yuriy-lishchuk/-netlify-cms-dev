Small and medium-size agencies worldwide produce a great deal of outstanding advertising, yet creative competitions are dominated by large advertising agencies, large clients, and large budgets.

Since 1994, the Summit Creative Award has recognized creative firms and helped them stand out in the crowd. This international advertising competition offers participants a unique opportunity to showcase their talents alongside similarly positioned agencies, and to have their work judged by experts in the advertising field. Our exclusive award-selection process means winners have earned the right to broadcast their achievements far and wide.

Companies and individuals from more than 50 countries and across five continents have participated in this prestigious 25-year competition â€“ the first and best of its kind.

The Summit Awards is the oldest and most prestigious organization administering marketing awards exclusively for small firms. Throughout our twenty-five year history, the SIA Creative Award is established as one of the premier indicators of creative and communication excellence. Using stringent evaluation criteria and a blind judging process, the Summit International Awards competitions reward only those firms whose work exemplifies the best in its class.
