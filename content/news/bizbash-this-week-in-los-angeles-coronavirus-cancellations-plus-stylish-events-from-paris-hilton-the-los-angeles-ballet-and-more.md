West Coast editor Claire Hoffman covers the week's biggest event news.

**Spotlight On**  
Paris Hilton's birthday party took place on February 27 at a private residence in Beverly Hills. Produced by [Mirrored Media](https://www.bizbash.com/13458422), the event had a "#Sliv Your Best Life" theme—based on Hilton's go-to catchphrase mashing up "slaying" and "living." The venue was transformed into "Slivington Manor," with a photo booth from [Dose of Roses](https://www.dose-roses.com/) plus specialty cocktails from Casamigos and a late-night pizza delivery from Pizza Hut; additional sponsors included Mod Champagne and Smart Water. Topping off the over-the-top extravagance? BMW created a custom, pastel-colored BMW i8 "Slivmobile" specifically for Hilton's birthday.
