# Awesomeness Summer Beach House

After a busy 2017, Awesomeness decided it was time to reward its clients and creators with a relaxing and refreshing couple of weeks on the beach. From July 24th to August 7th, Mirrored Media and Awesomeness teamed up to transform a beautiful Santa Monica beach house into a summer oasis for talent, creators, and clients alike. The three-story house, which sat just steps from the sand north of the famous Santa Monica Pier, featured pool parties, press mixers, leadership panels, and so much more throughout the two weeks.

## **The House:**

Located on beautiful Pacific Coast Highway in Santa Monica, the Awesomeness Beach House featured all of the things creators have come to expect from the Awesomeness brand. Mirrored Media brought in carefully manicured decor and furniture, and crafted the grounds and surrounding areas with custom items to give guests the feeling of an ultimate summer getaway.

The first floor interior had comfortable sofas and chairs, a catering area, and was attached to a patio with large open doors, allowing the ocean breeze to flow into the space.

The second floor master bedroom was transformed into a production suite, with stunning 180-degree ocean views outside its large windows.

The third floor became a beautiful infinity-style Instagram room, featuring a forest of hanging string lights, mirrored walls, branding, beach balls, and glowing triangular LEDs. This room was a huge hit among guests, with thousands of impressions via social media.

## **The Yard:**

The inside of the house was just the beginning. The backyard featured many of the highlights of this summer oasis, most notably, the pool. While it was a huge hit during many of the day parties, Mirrored Media recognized the need for extra space during larger events at night. On two occasions, we had a custom convertible pool cover installed to provide an additional 450 square feet of ground space. The cover was sturdy enough to hold groups of people, tables, and chairs, making it an ideal option to convert the space for various types of events.

Other standout features of the yard included:

- Custom neon signs
- Mirror decals
- Balcony banners
- String lights
- Uplighting
- Branded corn hole
- Giant Jenga
- “Awesome” mirror letters
- Pool toys
- Light-up LED bar
- Downlighting
- Gobos
- An LED lemon tree

## **The Activations:**
