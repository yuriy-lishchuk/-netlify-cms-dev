Producing a vintage automobile race on a beach was unchartered territory for the Mirrored Media team when they were called upon to execute the first ever West Coast version of The Race of Gentlemen.  The Oilers Car Club and Stultz & Green Productions partnered with Mirrored Media to bring their event to Grover Beach, California in October 2016. Hundreds of racers along with over 20,000 fans and aficionados joined together to celebrate (in 1930's fashion) the tradition of American racing and hot rod heritage.

As ye olde Mariners and watermen would say, “Time and tide wait for no man.”  -TROG

Alas, this statement hit a little closer to home than we had hoped, as the entire production was nearly wiped out by some of the highest tides the Pismo/Grover Beach area has seen in decades, with sporadic rain showers and heavy fog throughout the weekend.  Originally set in New Jersey, it was the first time in history that The Race of Gentlemen was to be hosted in California where, in October, the weather is typically predictable and cooperative.  Though the weather indeed did not cooperate, the production team worked around the obstacles (including a small lake that formed in the middle of the race track) and the show continued on to be a great success, with hundreds of vintage cars, trucks, and motorcycles getting their chance to race on the 1/8 of a mile stretch of wet, but nevertheless operative beach.

The entire event was carefully crafted to emulate the 1930s.  The tents and staging, barrel bars, custom signage, and employee uniforms were handpicked and/or designed by the Mirrored Media and TROG teams to ensure period correctness at every turn.  More importantly, cars were restricted to bodies pre-1935 and parts predating 1953, while motorcycles were required to be stripped down, American made, and pre-1947.

Despite weather and tide setbacks, the debut of TROG West was a phenomenal experience for participants and attendees alike; proof that The Race of Gentlemen truly is the greatest race on Earth!
