# Mirrored Media Produces Mene 24K Halloween Party, Hosted by Alessandra Ambrosio and Darren Dzienciol

She is usually seen in a pair of angel wings, but Alessandra Ambrosio decided to take on another fantasy creature this year as she hosted the Mene 24k Halloween party in Los Angeles on Tuesday produced by Mirrored Media.

The Victoria's Secret Model, 36, looked alluring in a cleavage-baring unicorn costume while joined by a long list of stars including 53-year-old rock singer Courtney Love. Alessandra cut a stylish figure as she showed off her glittery chest in a skin tight white bodysuit.

The Brazilian model's sexy costume was paired with a pair of thigh-high white boot-heels, which she teamed over matching fishnet-tights. The lingerie clotheshorse showed off her look in sexy snap for Instagram, alongside the caption: 'Sweet dreams are made of these.......#unicorn #styledbyinspiresmi'.

The sexy siren was joined at her event by rock legend Courtney Love. The widow of Kurt Cobain dressed as a 20s-inspired flapper girl, by wearing a black dress and a chic feathered boa. The 53-year-old finished her ensemble with black tights and matching ankle-strap heels. Courtney kept her shoulder-length blonde locks down, while accentuating her plumped pout with a red lip-color.

Also at the event was Alessandra's finance Jamie Mazur, who attended the Halloween party as a furry werewolf. The Halloween mask was the same one Jamie sported earlier in the day when the doting parents took their five-year-old son Noah trick-or-treating. The happy couple were spotted at the Mene 24k party with millionaire James Goldstein, who seemed to have dressed as himself for the Halloween event.

Rapper Tyga was one of the more festive attendees, who transformed himself into Jim Carrey's 1994 character from The Mask. The ex-boyfriend of Kylie Jenner sported a yellow suite, while also painting his face a bright green color. Actor Chuck Liddell was seen dressed up as a priest, while his wife Heidi Northcott looked like a sinful sexy maid.
