#### Live.me @ Playlist Live DC

Mirrored Media joined forces with Live.me, the fastest growing app for broadcasting and watching live streaming videos, for Playlist Live's annual annual 3 day conference, which took place in Washington DC this year.  The event brought together online creators and their biggest supporters for a weekend of meet ups, performances, discussions, interactive games, live Q&As, intimate panels, and performances by some of today's most popular influencers.

On Saturday and Sunday, Live.me hosted a recharge lounge where attendees were able to kickback, charge their devices, and even do a live broadcast.  There were also special giveaways designed specifically for the Playlist Live DC crowd with special premiums awarded to those who used the live.me hashtag.
