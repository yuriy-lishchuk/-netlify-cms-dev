To kick off VidCon at TubeFilterâ€™s party, Mirrored Media went out to K1 Raceway to help Google Play host a high-stakes tournament that offered fans the chance to watch online superstars go head to head in Google Play mobile games.

The Mirrored Media team helped create the ultimate Observation Deck so that the competition overlooked the entire indoor racetrack. Fans were then picked from the audience to stand in the middle of the action, cheering on their favorite YouTube or Vine stars as they battled each other in games such as Beach Buggy Racing. Nowhere else could you see GloZell and Crazy Russian Hacker duke it out to see who comes out at the top in their dune buggy cars!

In between the battle rounds, online superstar Alex Wassabi went into the crowd to take selfies and talk to fans. The entire evening was a special opportunity for the crowd to get close to their favorite YouTube and Vine stars, before the VidCon madness even began!
