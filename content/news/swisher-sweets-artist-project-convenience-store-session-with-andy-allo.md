Swisher Sweets' Swisher Artist Project is an ongoing initiative to provide artists with unique opportunities to create, share and pursue their passion. And it does not forget about the fans – the Artist Project allows fans to be at the forefront of what’s new and emerging in the world of music, arts, and entertainment. That means going beyond just sharing new music with the world. Artists get the chance to showcase their talents in experiential settings that music fans will enjoy and remember.
