To celebrate the release of Matt Groening's newest Netflix series, _Disenchantment_, Fullscreen partnered with Mirrored Media to design and fabricate 10 custom pedicabs inspired by the carriages seen on the show. During RTX, any attendees with a convention badge were given complimentary pedicab rides throughout Austin. The pedicabs lined up right outside the convention center next to “YE OLDE FREE RIDESHARE” signs, with drivers clad in branded shirts calling out to guests advertising their bikes. In a city known for its pedicabs, riders were transported in style to various RTX hotels, parties, screenings, and panels throughout the three-day event. In total, over 1400 rides were provided to over 2800 passengers.
