With $100,000 on the line, TBS’s new hit show _GO-BIG SHOW_ showcases supersized talents on a scale never before seen on television with a cast of all-star celebrity judges Snoop Dogg, Jennifer Nettles, Rosario Dawson and Cody Rhodes. Featuring monster truck flipping, rattlesnake wrangling and other incredible feats, the program celebrates daring acts alongside personal, behind-the-scenes stories from challengers as they battle head-to-head to impress the show’s panel of judges and advance toward the finale’s ultimate prize.

“As the largest sports bar in the country, Buffalo Wild Wings can deliver BIG flavors to fans of the GO-BIG SHOW, and the opportunity partner with TBS on its new show was a no-brainer,” said Chad Glidewell, Director of Sports Marketing and Partnerships, Buffalo Wild Wings. “This is a great partnership between two preeminent experience brands that allows us to enhance the at-home viewing experience of our guests while they watch the GO-BIG SHOW.”

There’s only one meal big enough when the GO-BIG SHOW debuts on January 7 at 9 p.m. ET and that’s the Buffalo Wild Wings GO-BIG BUNDLE, featuring 20 traditional wings, 20 boneless wings and fries for just $39.99. This bundle is available nationwide at all participating sports bars.

“In celebration of TBS’s new hit extreme competition series GO-BIG SHOW, BWW went BIG and created the Go-Big Bundle at all of their sports bars,” said Telmo Tebuas, SVP Brand Marketing for TBS. “One of the most unique aspects of Go-Big Show was the energy from the audience of tailgaters that were outside the coliseum every night as we were filming. This partnership allows all of our fans to join the tailgate fun and watch from the comfort of their own homes. At TBS, we believe you have to Go-Big or go home and, with the Go-Big Bundle, our fans can enjoy the most extreme talent competition ever with friends and family.”

Check out the official trailer above and enjoy the GO-BIG BUNDLE at your [local sports bar](https://www.buffalowildwings.com/en/locations/) or from the comfort of your own home with delivery through the Buffalo Wild Wings mobile app, available via the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blazin-rewards/id1031364004) and the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.buffalowildwings.blazinrewards&hl=en).
