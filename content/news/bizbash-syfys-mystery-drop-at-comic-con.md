Syfy also worked with Mirrored Media on a merchandise giveaway. The network tapped three famous comic artists—Babs Tarr, Kim Jung Gi, and Jock—and two streetwear brands, who worked together to created limited-edition merchandise. Fans could stop by the New Children’s Museum every morning to grab the items, which sold out in minutes every day.
