[![IMG_4248](http://www.mirroredmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_4248.jpg)](http://www.mirroredmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG_4248.jpg)Experiential marketing agency, Mirrored Media, was tapped to produce multi Grammy® nominated singer, songwriter, and music producer Kaskade’s special Pop Up Shop to Los Angeles the week prior to his landmark SOLD OUT performance at the Los Angeles Convention Center on May 7th.

The Pop Up shop will host performances from local DJs and feature exclusive Kaskade merchandise including t-shirts, hats, bandanas, tote bags, and more. Additionally, fans will be able to purchase exclusive photography from Mark Owens and merchandise from Kaskade’s Imperial Motion Capsule Collection.

“We are beyond thrilled to have the opportunity to bring Kaskade’s vision to life. The concept was to bring fans together and celebrate the career of one of the world’s most famous EDM pioneers,” said Justin Lefkovitch, Founder and CEO of Mirrored Media.

Mirrored Media teamed up with Kaskade to create the pop up shop experience that Kaskade envisioned – this included everything from finding the perfect venue to designing the atmosphere and layout within the store. Mirrored Media worked closely with Kaskade and his team to ensure that all elements of the pop up shop were precisely what Kaskade imagined.

Kaskade’s Pop Up Shop will be located at 410 N. Fairfax Ave in Los Angeles and will be open from Tuesday, May 3rd through Saturday, May 7th between 12:00p – 8:00p. True to Kaskade form, fans should expect the man himself to stop by the store throughout the week.

Kaskade’s highly anticipated May 7th performance at LACC sold out immediately, selling over 20,00 tickets. The show, produced by Insomniac, will be the largest solo headlining live date of Kaskade’s career and the first dance music event to take place in the Convention Center’s 45-year history.
