#### About the Davey Awards:

The Davey Awards is an international award focused exclusively on honoring outstanding creative work from the best small shops from across the world. The 15th Annual Davey Awards received nearly 3,000 entries from ad agencies, digital agencies, production firms, in-house creative professionals, graphic designers, design firms and public relations firms. David defeated the mighty Goliath with a big idea and a little rock. That is the sort of thing small agencies do every day. The Davey Awards honors the achievements of the “Creative David’s” where strength comes from ideas, intelligence and out -of-the-box thinking, not a “Giant’s” bankroll. Great work is about fresh ideas and exceptional execution, not the biggest budgets. The Davey levels the playing field so entrants compete with only their peers and can win the recognition they deserve.
