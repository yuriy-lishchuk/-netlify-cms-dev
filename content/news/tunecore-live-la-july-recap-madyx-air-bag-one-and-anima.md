TuneCore Live’s July party at the Bardot was truly one of the best ones yet. We had an amazing turnout and hope that people left the Bardot with a few new favorite songs to add to their summer playlists.

Doors swung open to a flood of partygoers and curious music fans who roamed the venue to grab drinks, make friends, and warm up to DJ Biggie Smiles’ set.

Soon afterwards, MADYX took the stage, commanding all attention with her incredible chops and fierce attitude. MADYX wowed the crowd on her guitar, while also surprising them with her own rock rendition of Nick Jonas’ silky “Chains.” MADYX deserves major props for bringing such an explosive, dynamic voice into the pop rock world.

We were lucky to snag indie rock band Air Bag One for TuneCore Live, as they are currently on tour before they head back to their hometown in France. The guys performed a set of lush, infectious songs that slowly began to pull the crowd closer to the stage. By the middle of their set, their magnetic appeal had everyone dancing.

Anima! delivered one of the most eclectic sets we’ve ever seen, bringing out a set of lanterns that lit up to the beat. At this point of the night, the venue was packed and vivacious, with fans standing up on booths and chairs to sing and clap along. The evening ended on a very high note, as Anima! proved themselves as a brilliantly crafty band.

In between bands’ sets and afterwards, our favorite DJ William Lifestyle continued to propel the party forward into the late hours.

We hope that everyone had a blast at July’s TuneCore Live! Swisher Sweets, Swing House, and Celebuzz continue to be amazing with their outpouring support of the event! Onwards and upwards: we are picking up the momentum for August’s TuneCore Live. Come celebrate with us next month!
