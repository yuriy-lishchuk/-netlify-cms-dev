TuneCore's second annual Indie Artist Forum took place in the musical hot bed of downtown Nashville, TN on February 19th & 20th, 2016.

The event kicked off with an industry luncheon, followed by an industry mixer Friday evening. TuneCore teamed up with Mirrored Media to produce this two day event, held at [Acme Feed & Seed](http://theacmenashville.com/).

The goal of the event was to hold discussions with independent music makers and songwriters, share wisdom from folks in the field, and revel in performances by talented [TuneCore](http://www.tunecore.com) Artists based in the creative city. Attendees began to line up outside the venue as early as 9:00 AM, and not long after, the Forum was underway! Eager artists and songwriters checked in, mingled and grabbed some breakfast, all while catching a performance by singer-songwriter **Justin Klump**.

Just a couple hours after **R.LUM.R** wrapped up his set, the Acme Feed & Seed was transformed and **TuneCore Live: Nashville** was underway!

Up first was the brand new **Nightly**, followed by country artist **Ray Scott** and and country singer Meghan Linsey (who was also featured on The Voice in 2015!)

A special thanks goes out to all of the guest speakers, performing artists, sponsors and the independent artists who took time out of their weekend to work on their career and join us for what turned out to be an amazing day of learning and discussion. We cannot wait to do it all again!
