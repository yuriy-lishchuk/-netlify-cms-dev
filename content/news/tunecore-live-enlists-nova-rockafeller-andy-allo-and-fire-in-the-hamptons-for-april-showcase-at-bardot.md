Is it just us, or did March absolutely flash before our eyes? The good news is, at the end of ANY month in 2015, you’ve been able to rely on another [TuneCore Live](http://live.tunecore.com/) #SwisherArtistProject event - you're welcome.

Last month was a tremendous success, with three performers who brought the country-folk vibe to the stage. This Wednesday, April 29, we’re stepping it up in the dance and funk department, where you can expect high-energy performances by artists Andy Allo, Fire In The Hamptons and Nova Rockafeller.

With help from our awesome sponsors, Tunecore, Mirrored Media, DropKloud and Swinghouse, we’re looking forward to another packed house!
