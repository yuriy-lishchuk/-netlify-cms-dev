Check out the lineup for the [BrooklynVegan](http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2013/03/brooklynvegan_f.html) free SXSW Friday day party! Excited to be on board with [mophie](http://www.mophie.com). Awesome bands including The Polyphonic Spree, Akron/Family, The Thermals, Shout Out Louds, Half Moon Run and many more!

Keeping your mobile device charged at SXSW is always a challenge. BrooklynVegan will stay powered up all week thanks to mophie, who will also be on-site at our events, giving away passes and discount cards to the “mophie Mobile Shop” that will be conveniently located right down the street all week at 519 East 7th St.
