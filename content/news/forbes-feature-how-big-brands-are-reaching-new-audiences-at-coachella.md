Coachella CHRISTOPHER POLK FOR TEEN VOGUE.

Coachella has become one of the biggest festivals in the country with over 125,000 attendees each weekend this past year which does not include the number of people that travel to the area for the parties or activations. It is estimated that Golden Voices' Coachella and Stagecoach generate approximately [$900 million](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-coachella-economy-by-the-numbers-20160420-story.html) in economic activity around the Coachella Valley area. With the majority of attendees contributing to the almost billion dollars in economic activity consisting of Gen Z and millennials, major brands have the opportunity to build relationships with new audiences that they would not typically interact with otherwise.

“For brands, identifying influencers is easy. Paying them to post is easier. Building a trusting relationship where both sides can add value to the other (without feeling used) is the ultimate challenge. ‘Return On Influence’ is the new ROI,” says Christopher Rockwell of LOVE, a brand strategist who helps companies like Audi, Fendi, and Google. 

Revolve has [proven](https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrysamaha/2018/04/16/revolve-clothing-fashion-influencer-coachella-2018-michael-mente-interview/) that activating at Coachella is a must for brands looking to boost revenues while staying culturally relevant. But Revolve isn't the only brand that shines its presence in the desert; Express, BMW, American Express, Create & Cultivate, Rachel Zoe, Levi's and Neon Carnival have all invested in creating an experience to connect with existing customers while reaching a new audience.

BMW returned to the desert for #roadtocoachella produced by Mirrored Media with Khalid as their 2019 artist. Khalid designed the art for a fleet of BMW i8's to be driven down to the popup by influencers and celebrities. At the popup, fans got to meet Khalid, shop the collab merch and test out the i8's. BMW has taken an unconventional approach in making its activation more about a lifestyle rather than a car.

“As the world´s most vibrant music and art festival, Coachella is an ideal match from a brand perspective. At BMW, joy is in our DNA, and with experiences like #roadtocoachella, we are able to connect authentically, yet unconventionally with young (at heart) people in a very emotional way. Coachella broadens our community from an automotive company to a more accessible & inspiring lifestyle mobility brand.”  Stefan Ponikva head of BMW events and BMW group shows.
