Mirrored Media, leader in experiential marketing and music strategy, will be producing some of Comic-Con's largest and most exciting events this year. Clients include CraveOnline, the largest online male lifestyle publisher, and 20th Century Fox.

Mirrored Media partnered once again with CraveOnline to produce one of the most highly anticipated events at Comic-Con, _Crave Escape,_ aboard San Diego's USS Midway. Over 2,000 fans will gather to enjoy exclusive performances by Cold War Kids, Bad Suns and Cathedrals;Â  as well as a _Best of Gaming Cosplay Fashion Show._ The evening will be hosted by OITNB actress, Taryn Manning.

Additionally, Mirrored Media was tapped by 20th Century Fox to produce a daytime event, which features 47 agents hitting the streets of downtown San Diego for the upcoming release of Hitman: Agent 47, an adaptation of the popular video game franchise.

"We are so excited to bring CraveOnline back after last year's huge success, as well as add new amazing partners to this year's Comic-Con. It's an incredible opportunity to have our team's vision come to life in such a creative and fun way," said Justin Lefkovitch, CEO and Founder of Mirrored Media. "Our goal is to create a unique experience not only for fans and our clients, but also for the talent involved."

Mirrored Media's big Comic-Con weekend comes on the heels of being included in Event Markerter's coveted 2015 _IT LIST_, as one of the top experiential marketing agencies.
