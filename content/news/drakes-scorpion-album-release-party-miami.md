Mirrored Media helped Drake ring in the release of his new album _Scorpion_ at Miami club,  E11EVEN, last weekend. Mirrored brought in a photo booth activation that featured a larger than life scorpion. Party-goers took home sharable gifs of themselves dancing with the album's icon.

"The singer arrived Friday night at club E11EVEN Miami with a crew of more than 50 including rapper Party Next Door and hip-hop producer Murda Beatz.

A spokesperson for the club said the DJ jumped into the booth and played songs from Drake’s new album _Scorpion_.

The highly anticipated, 25-track album was released Friday. The album is expected to debut at No. 1, and has been trending heavily on social media ahead of its release."
