Our favorite artists from this past year’s Anaheim Sessions are back again at Anaheim Marriott! In November we are excited to welcome back familiar and new faces to the singer-songwriter stage at the nFuse Lounge. Some of them are even coming back for multiple sets all throughout the month. It’s going to be a busy month for all of us who love getting away to hear good singer-songwriters after work!

Anaheim Sessions is a continuing monthly songwriter showcase hosted by the Anaheim Marriott. It is an opportunity for us to create a stage for songwriters throughout Southern California to grow a fanbase and show off their talent. Stop by nFuse Lounge this month to catch some of our favorites!
