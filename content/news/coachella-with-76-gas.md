Mirrored Media teamed up with CraveOnline and 76 Gas to create a tricked out branded ice cream truck that gave Coachellites items you'd need to make it through the festival. During both weekends the 76 Gas truck made stops at the hottest party's, campsites, and parking lots. All festival enthusiasts got a 76 survival kit. In these kits Coachellites found limp balm, for their dry desert dancing lips, bandanas, for their stylish SANDsational outfits, and sunglasses, so the sets were seen without shine. Occasionally, these festival goers found 76 Gas gift cards in the kits. 76 Gas also randomly selected a few 76 tweets and those Coachellites won a $100 gift card. #LongCut #We'reOnTheDriversSide
