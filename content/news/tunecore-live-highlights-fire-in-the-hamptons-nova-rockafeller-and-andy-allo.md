The night began with a packed performance by fish-out-of-water rapper **[Nova Rockefeller](https://twitter.com/novarockafeller)**, whose set combined the artist’s flair for raw rhymes, melodic rock-driven raucous, and laugh-out-loud wackiness. Defying easy categorization, Nova got people jumping, fists occasionally pumping, and left the crowd eager for more.

Last but certainly not least, Cameroonian-born artist [**Andy Allo**](http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/alloevolution.com) stepped up like a beautiful pop-funk vision of the future, taking us on a musical journey punctuated by an ultra soulful rendition of Springsteen’s “Dancing In The Dark.”
