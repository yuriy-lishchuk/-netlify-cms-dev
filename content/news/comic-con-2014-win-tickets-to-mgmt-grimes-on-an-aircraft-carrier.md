Entrants should only apply if they plan on being in San Diego next weekend, or are close enough to make it down for the event. Winners must be 21+ to get in! What better way to catch a break from the noisy lines and cosplay overload of Comic-Con than to take part in an exclusive concert on the monumental aircraft carrier, the USS Midway? Adjacent to the Convention Center and Comic-Con epicenter, the USS Midway is just a short walk away from the costumed mayhem, where two premier musical acts — MGMT and Grimes — will serve our die-hard music enthusiasts an unforgettable experience, and will set the perfect tone for the most memorable event Comic-Con has yet to see.

Come rock with Crave and TNT on the USS Midway next Friday at Comic-Con!
