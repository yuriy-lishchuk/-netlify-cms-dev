In celebration of the third installment of the _Planet of the Apes_ reboot series, Mirrored Media teamed up with Fullscreen to activate the excitement of the film's release with unique promotional instillations at RTX in Austin.  Upon entering the Austin Convention Center, attendees were welcomed to the weekend-long convention by a collection of _War for the Planet of the Apes_ signage and artwork that was systematically positioned for high visibility.  Each person had to pass by or through these awe-inspiring installations on site, with a standout being the custom-designed holograms sitting atop a truss above the main entrance. These holograms featured custom designed rotating images of the film's logo accompanied by eye-catching shapes and designs. 

Mirrored Media also created a first-of-its-kind waterfall fog screen which projected imagery from the film onto the fog, through which guests walked though to enter the convention center's main doors.  This interactive experience not only generated excitement for guests passing through, but also gave them an epic photo opportunity. 

To complete the overall aesthetics, Mirrored Media strategically placed oversized _War for the Planet of the Apes_ signage in the massive Convention Center windows along with pull-up banners and a step and repeat area in the main walkway near the entrance. 

Fans took notice of the awe-inspiring activations, as the film topped the box office on its opening weekend, earning over $50 million.
