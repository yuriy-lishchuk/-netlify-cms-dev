# BMW Premier Partner Experience Tour

In order to highlight BMW’s partnership and employee discount program Mirrored Media teamed up with the automotive giant to present an exclusive experience for team members at each of these western region company locations. The BMW Premier Partner Experience gave guests an opportunity to learn more about, and even test drive, several models from the BMW family.

From 10am – 5pm, registered employees were able to stop by the activation, located on a large portion of the campus’ parking lot, and become fully immersed in the BMW brand. Upon entering, guests were given BMW-branded reusable water bottles provided by S’well. They were greeted with two standout BMWs on display both sitting on custom on-brand platforms. Employees were invited to take a seat inside each car, while BMW produce geniuses were on hand to offer more information and assistance. Guests were also invited to step into the photo booth, which featured a co-branded custom step and repeat.

A large branded BMW semi-truck provided a backdrop for the VIP lounge. Located adjacent to the truck, and covered by a large BMW canopy, this carpeted area featured several perks for employees to enjoy, including:

- Gourmet donuts
- Gourmet coffee bar
- Cold Refreshments
- Two TVs featuring branded content
- White lounge furniture
- Floral decor and planters
- BMW music playlist

The highlights of the day were the three exhilarating driving experiences. Guests had the opportunity to get behind the wheel of one of 13 BMWs, including the i3, M2, M4 Convertible, X5, 530e, or X6, for an exclusive test drive in one of three scenarios:

- Accel/Decel: Drivers accelerate rapidly then hit the brakes on a closed course
- Slalom: Drivers hug tight corners between cones on a closed course
- Neighborhood Street Drive: Drivers were able to take the cars for a test drive around the neighborhood with a product specialist.
