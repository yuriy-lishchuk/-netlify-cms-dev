PR Daily has revealed the finalists for the 2018 Content Marketing Awards, which recognizes brand storytellers who know their way around a clickable headline, a viral video, or a fleeting social trend. Storytelling is the most valuable skill a communicator can have today. The platforms we use to tell our stories, along with how those stories meet larger business goals, can make all the difference when measuring content marketing success. Mirrored Media is honored to announce that we’ve been named as finalists for two 2018 Content Marketing Awards for our BMW i Road to Coachella Campaign.
