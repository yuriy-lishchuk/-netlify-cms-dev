# The Chainsmokers, Demi Lovato & More Help Emo Nite LA Celebrate Three Years at Emo Nite Day Mini Festival

12/7/2017 by [Kat Bein](https://www.billboard.com/author/6516813)

"Emo ain't dead, and it ain't even really that sad. In fact, it might be thriving, at least in Los Angeles where beloved monthly Emo Nite recently celebrated three years of happy tears and "XD rawr" text messages with a full-day Emo Nite Day mini festival at LA's Shrine Expo Hall and Grounds.

The official lineup boasted a special acoustic performance by [The Used](https://www.billboard.com/music/the-used), [Machine Gun Kelly](https://www.billboard.com/music/machine-gun-kelly), [Tigers Jaw](https://www.billboard.com/music/tigers-jaw), Craig Owens and more, as well as DJ sets by members of [From First To Last](https://www.billboard.com/music/from-first-to-last), [Vic Fuentes](https://www.billboard.com/music/vic-fuentes), William Becket of [The Academy Is](https://www.billboard.com/music/the-academy-is) and others. Yet the stage erupted with more unannounced performances from [Demi Lovato](https://www.billboard.com/music/demi-lovato), [The Chainsmokers](https://www.billboard.com/music/the-chainsmokers), [Lil' Aaron](https://www.billboard.com/music/lil-aaron), [Finch](https://www.billboard.com/music/finch), Frank Zummo of [Sum 41](https://www.billboard.com/music/sum-41), among others.

Lovato reportedly performed a special "punk rock" version of her current hit "Sorry Not Sorry." From First To Last debuted a new song called "Surrender," featuring ordinal lead singer Sonny Moore, aka [Skrillex](https://www.billboard.com/music/skrillex). California hip-hopper [Travis Mills](https://www.billboard.com/music/travis-mills) performed a special tribute to recently deceased rapper [Lil Peep](https://www.billboard.com/music/lil-peep), while The Chainsmokers joined [Captain Cuts](https://www.billboard.com/music/captain-cuts) for a surprise drop of jams including "Closer."

"The last three years have been a wild, wild ride," Emo Nite's founders are quoted in a message to fans. "Never in our wildest dreams when we decided to invite a few of our friends on a Tuesday nite to a dive bar in Echo Park to listen to emo and pop punk music, that it would turn into something like this. Thank you guys for building and fostering such a special community. Thank you for growing with us and supporting this thing through all of the different stages this party has gone through. Yesterday only made us more excited for the future of Emo Nite and we couldn't ask for a better family to be on this journey with us."
