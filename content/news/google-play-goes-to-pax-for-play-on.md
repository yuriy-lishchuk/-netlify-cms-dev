We had an amazing week at PAX in Seattle! Thanks to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store?hl=en) and [Portal A](http://portal-a.com/) for having us on board again to help out with the [Game On challenge](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrRK02_CbvPEPrDYMQ1l49w), where we invited YouTube gamers to battle each other in a mobile gaming tournament for a live audience. Taking the same energy from our successes at VidCon, we were excited that we could bring it to a giant room of people who love the online gaming community just as much as we do. Check out more images from the event below.
