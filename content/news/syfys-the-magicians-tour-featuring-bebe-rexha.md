The Magicians, the new show based on Lev Grossman's series of novels, is coming to Syfy on January 25. However, prior to that, the show is going on tour with singer/songwriter Bebe Rexha for some advanced screenings (and performances by Bebe, obviously). All you need to know is below:

What Is It?: In each venue (listed below), the first episode of The Magicians will be screened and hosted by a different social media personality (again, list below). Bebe will be there and will perform. Also, there will be tons of free stuff.

Who is Bebe Rexha? If you know the answer to this question, skip ahead. But for virgins to the house of Rexha, she's a singer/songwriter with quite an impressive resume. She co-wrote "The Monster" with Eminem (the song features Rihanna), she's the lead singer of The Black Cards, and was featured on the singles "Take Me Home" by Cash Cash and "Hey Mama" by David Guetta. Here she is in action: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EapQHW\_QTw
