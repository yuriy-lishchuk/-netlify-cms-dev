MIRRORED MEDIA HONORED WITH 2016 SUMMIT INTERNATIONAL CREATIVE AWARD

Out of more than 5,000 submissions from 21 countries, Mirrored Media was named a winner during the 2016 Summit Creative Awards for their expertise in engagement and experiential marketing for one of their latest campaigns, _The Magicians_ Premiere tour with Syfy.

Mirrored Media was tapped to promote Syfy’s upcoming original series, _The Magicians._  Syfy needed to create a promotional campaign that would cut through the entertainment clutter and reach the show’s target audience – Millennials.

Mirrored Media hit on key millennial passion points like music, social experiences, and events by partnering with Syfy, Warner Bros. Records and Fullscreen to embark on a five market college tour to promote _The Magicians_. Each tour stop was hosted by a different popular social media personality and featured an advance screening of the first episode, a live acoustic performance by millennial musician Bebe Rexha, cast appearances, branded concessions and shareable social activations.

By partnering with Bebe Rexha, the campaign was able to reach authentic music fans. The partnership married the two brands together by debuting Bebe’s new, never before heard single “No Broken Hearts” in a _Magicians_ trailer. Bebe promoted the tour prior to and during on all of her social platforms, including behind the scenes footage, and shared _The Magicians_ trailer. Bebe Rexha ended the night with performances of her biggest hits, which resulted in attendees chronicling the tour and sharing their experiences to social media platforms.

Mirrored Media also got social with millennials by tapping into social media influencers. Five different personalities shared custom created content across their social platforms to promote _The Magicians_. Each influencer hosted a different stop, introducing _The Magicians_ episode and Bebe, and used Snapchat to feature footage from the event; encouraging fans that weren’t able to attend to watch the pre-linear episode before the premiere.

In addition to Bebe Rexha and influencers promoting the tour, Mirrored Media and Syfy teamed up with NBC affiliate networks, local press and promoters in each market as well as college groups to drive attendees to each tour stop.
