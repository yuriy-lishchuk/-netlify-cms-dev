It’s hard to believe that we’ve now held four awesome, packed-to-the-hilt [TuneCore Live](http://live.tunecore.com/) events - but you better believe it! While performers from the January/February shows at Bardot and our TuneCore Live Austin SXSW party have ranged in genre from synth-pop and electro-indie to hip hop and straight ahead rock, our most recent bill featured artists who geared towards the singer/songwriter scene, with hints of Americana, folk and country sprinkled in.

As always, a big thank you is in order to our sponsors TuneCore, Swisher Sweets, Swinghouse, Dropkloud and Bardot-Hollywood, and to the amazing artists who performed - Sam Outlaw, George Byrne, and Alexander Cardinale.

CraveOnline did an excellent job at capturing the night on film for us and provided a great highlight reel of [interviews with the performers](http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/846993-tunecore-live-highlight-reel-sam-outlaw-alexander-cardinale-and-george-byrne-return-to-hollywood) below:

Kicking off the night’s festivities was [Sam Outlaw](http://twitter.com/thesamoutlaw), who brought a spectacular full band to give the audience the full experience of his ‘SoCal Country’-sound. We enjoyed songs from last year’s [self-titled EP](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sam-outlaw-ep/id854627313) as well as teasers from his upcoming release, _Angeleno._

Up next was the talented [George Byrne](http://twitter.com/george_byrne) and his band. Through his songs, Byrne shared his journey of packing up his things in his hometown of Sydney, Australia and heading an ocean away to Los Angeles.

With the crowd Cardinale shared his brand of sentimental, carefree, [folk-tinged pop](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/made-for-you/id907485740?i=907487893) that delighted all in attendance.

To make things even cooler, we had Taylor and Griffin Goldsmith of [DAWES](http://twitter.com/dawesofficial) bringing their tastes to the DJ booth for all to enjoy between sets!

Couldn’t make this one? No sweat! We’ll have another awesome TuneCore Live show at [Bardot on Wednesday, April 29th](http://live.tunecore.com/) – come hang out with us!
