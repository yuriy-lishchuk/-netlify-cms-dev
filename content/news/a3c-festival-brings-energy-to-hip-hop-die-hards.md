We’ve been having the hardest time recuperating from A3C Festival in Atlanta, only because we keep missing it so much!

Thank you to the good people at A3C for letting us be a part of one of the biggest hip-hop festivals out there. This is where it is all happens. We felt the good vibes, the kindness and passion of Atlanta, and the full force of live music.

We were able to catch a ton of our favorite artists from Day 1 with our TuneCore Live showcase to the very last night with Raury, Dej Loaf, Wiz Khalifa and tons more. We were able to surprise fans with a special appearance by Travis Porter and Jeezy at our TuneCore Live show. We got to geek out to the biggest legends, De La Soul. We met cool people at our Swisher Lounge out on the rooftop of Delightful Eatz.

In between sets, we ran backstage to catch artist interviews before they went on stage. All of these interviews will be available to view soon. We will keep you posted!

We are so grateful that we got to work as tirelessly as we did at A3C Festival. It was one of the highlights of our year! Hip-hop lives here.
