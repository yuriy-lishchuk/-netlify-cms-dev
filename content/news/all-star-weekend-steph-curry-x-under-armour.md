The 2017-2018 NBA season saw the league’s All-Star Game make its long-awaited return to Los Angeles. With it came a whole weekend of All-Star festivities, including the 3-Point Competition, Slam Dunk Contest, and a host of celebrity parties and special events. In February 2018, Steph Curry and Under Armour chose to host their weekend soiree at the famed Goldstein Mansion in Beverly Hills. Mirrored Media teamed up with Talent Resources to help produce this unforgettable evening.

Mirrored Media provided its all-star LED photo room for the exclusive gathering, adding Steph Curry and Under Armour branding to the interior and exterior. Our photo booth experience allowed guests to capture their own photos and instantly share them via email or their social media platform of choice. 

Mirrored also provided several other activations, including a Pop-a-Shot basketball game, live golf simulator, and a branded bar. Each of the activations were custom branded with SC and UA branding as well. The activations added fun and shareable elements to the very exclusive event, which was spread over two levels of the Goldstein property, including the downstairs Club James, and the tented upper tennis court.

Aside from the activations, guests enjoyed gourmet cuisine courtesy of chef Michael Mina, specially-crafted Avion cocktails, luxurious furniture, and breathtaking views of Los Angeles from the upper level. Downstairs in Club James, the guests enjoyed a nightclub vibe with specialty cocktails, basketball decor, dancing, and music from DJ Jus Ske. 

Notable guests in attendance included Steph Curry, Scottie Pippen, Joel Embiid, Joakim Noah, Nick Kroll, J.B. Smoove, and Jeezy.
