We’re so psyched to announce that The New Regime, FMLYBND and Drop City Yacht Club will be performing live at the next TuneCore Live show at Bardot-Hollywood on May 26. Last month was amazing, and with the help of our awesome sponsors - Swisher Sweets, TuneCore, SwingHouse, DropKloud and Celebuzz -  we're expecting another packed house.

If you haven't been to one of our shows yet, come down, let us know what you’re up to, ask us questions, and share some fun – our west coast team will be in attendance and ready to kick it.

Peep the flyer for more details and check out sample sounds from each artist below:
