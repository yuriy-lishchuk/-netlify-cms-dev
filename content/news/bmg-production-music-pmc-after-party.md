# BMG Production Music PMC After Party

Mirrored Media teamed up with BMG Production Music once again to host an exclusive party after the Production Music Conference in Hollywood.

The September 27th, 2018 event took place at Hollywoodâ€™s famed speakeasy No Vacancy. Over 500 BMG employees, clients, writers, and special guests gathered in the beautifully curated space to celebrate the full-service sound agency, its artists, and the men and women who make up the BMG team. After a long day at the Conference at the nearby Loews Hotel, guests were invited to kick back at No Vacancy to enjoy live entertainment, a DJ, an array of gourmet hors d'oeuvres, and specialty cocktails. Custom BMG branding and signage was ubiquitous throughout the vintage space in addition to a step and repeat at the event entrance. 

Guests were treated to a special performance by BMG songwriter and artist JimiJames, while DJ Kurse kept the party going late into the night. No Vacancy also provided a daring performance from Chris Grabher, an in-house tightrope walker who precariously made his way across the rope high above the guests below.

BMG came away elated with the turnout for the successful event, walking away with the record for most guests in the 106-year history of the iconic Hollywood venue.
