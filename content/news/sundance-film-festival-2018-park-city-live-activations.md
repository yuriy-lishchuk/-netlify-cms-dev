For the second year in a row, Mirrored Media teamed up with Fingerprint Communications for a full takeover of Park City Live during Sundance Film Festival. Celebrities, influencers, and special guests were invited to escape the cold and snow of Park City’s Main Street and experience a host of thought-provoking panels and activations.

Each of the six sponsors provided a much-needed respite to the hustle and bustle of Sundance in a warm and comfortable setting in the heart of Park City. They were all featured prominently on the branded step and repeat photo opportunity located at the venue entrance.

The three days of activations attracted a number of high-profile talent, including:

- Nicolas Cage
- will.i.am & Taboo of The Black Eyed Peas
- Paris Jackson
- Elijah Wood

### Sponsor activations included:

**Juul****:** Designed to improve the lives of the world’s estimated 1 billion smokers, this brand’s e-cig and vape alternative invited guests to relax in a carpeted lounge with cozy white furniture and chic decor. The brand name was displayed with life-sized backlit letters in this sophisticated lounge. Brand ambassadors were on hand to provide guests with more information.

For VIPs and talent, Juul had an upstairs lounge that provided a more exclusive experience and gifting suite. VIPs could even choose to have their samples custom-engraved on site.

**JetSmarter**: This members-only private jet charter service delivered the same luxurious VIP experience found on their planes in their comfortable lounge inside Park City Live. The carpeted space included high-end furniture, TVs displaying branded content, custom signage, elegant decor, and two JetSmarter brand reps available to help provide more information about this smarter, more cost-effective alternative to private jet travel. Guests were offered discount codes, branded bags and hats, and could even sign up on site via two iPad stations.

**SmashMallow**: Billed as America’s first snackable marshmallows, SmashMallow provided the perfect remedy to the frigid Utah temperatures: hot chocolate. Guests were invited to sip on fresh hot chocolate accompanied by one of the signature marshmallow flavors, including mocha chip, mint chocolate chip, cinnamon churro, and strawberry cream. These delicious treats could be dropped into their hot beverage or enjoyed on their own. Guests could also walk away with free SmashMallow t-shirts and hats.

**Nomatic**: This unique brand of functional, versatile, and high-quality bags was on hand to provide product giveaways to select VIPs throughout the weekend. Launched after a wildly successful Kickstarter campaign, Nomatic’s line of bags has become a trendy and fashionable high-end accessory.

**Creminelli Meats**: Salt Lake City-based Creminelli Fine Meats was on hand providing pre-packaged samples of some of its artisan meats. Selections of crackers, cheese, and several kinds of meats were available for guests to grab in a convenient package from branded refrigerators.

**Enso Rings**: These silicon rings were born out of an idea seen on the hit show, _Shark Tank_. Stationed just inside the front doors of Park City Live, Enso Rings provided guests with a fitted ring of their choice. Made of silicon instead of metal, these rings are a more comfortable and practical alternative to traditional rings.
