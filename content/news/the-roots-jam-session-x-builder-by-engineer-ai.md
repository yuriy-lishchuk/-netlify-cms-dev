Builder by Engineer.AI is your next generation partner for creating new apps and platforms. The Builder platform unites two essential engineering principles, building and operating, under a single common methodology. That’s why with Builder, you don’t have to be a coder to bring your next project to life - all you need is an idea.  

To showcase this platform’s incredible capabilities, Mirrored Media partnered Builder with Grammy Award-winning legends The Roots for their annual Grammy Jam. Occurring the week before the Grammy Awards, The Roots Jam Session is a two-day event that brings together an eclectic and unforgettable mix of musicians for an impromptu jam session with backing from the Legendary Roots Crew; a group that Rolling Stone magazine has called “one of the 20 greatest live acts in the world.”

Guest performers included:

- 2 Chainz
- Anderson .Paak
- Esperanza Spaldin
- Jorja Smith
- Swizz Beatz

...and many, many more.

With this caliber of guest on the list, The Roots needed a platform that they could customize and trust. That’s why they collaborated with Builder to create a personalized platform that they were able to easily upload their list of attendee names into, with multiple different ticket types. This new platform allowed the Roots to own the process from start to finish - as opposed to trying to work around a pre-built, generic RSVP platform like Eventbrite. Onsite, managers had admin access direct from their phones, while check-in staff raved about the ease of the platform and its ability to easily search guests by their first or last name _and_ by the individual who invited them. Plus, with a one touch check-in, we kept the line moving while also ensuring that there were no accidental duplicates, repetitions, or errors.
